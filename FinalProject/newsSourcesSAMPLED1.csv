New York Times,Q1ZMitch Smith,"Q1ZMinnesota Officer Was ‘Reacting to the Presence of a Gun,’ Lawyer Says - The New York Times","Q1ZST. ANTHONY, Minn.  —   A lawyer for the suburban police officer who fatally shot a black man during a traffic stop said on Saturday that the race of the driver, Philando Castile, played no role in how his client responded, and that the officer “was reacting to the presence of a gun” when he opened fire. The comments from the lawyer, Thomas Kelly, provided the fullest accounting yet of Officer Jeronimo Yanez’s version of the shooting Wednesday night, even as many details remain unclear. Officer Yanez, of the St. Anthony police, is on leave while state authorities investigate the shooting, which has prompted protests and raised questions about what role race might have played in the stop. “The shooting had nothing to do with race and everything to do with the presence of that gun,” Mr. Kelly said in an interview, noting that Officer Yanez is Latino. Mr. Castile “was not following the directions of the police officer,” Mr. Kelly said, but he declined to provide further detail. Much of what is known about the shooting comes from a Facebook Live video of the aftermath streamed by Mr. Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds. In that video, in which Mr. Castile is seen bleeding profusely in the driver’s seat, Ms. Reynolds tells the officer that her boyfriend had been reaching for his identification when he was shot. She also suggested that he had a permit to legally carry a gun. “Please, officer, don’t tell me that you just did this to him,” Ms. Reynolds said in the video, which quickly gained international attention. “You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir. ” In the video, Ms. Reynolds said her boyfriend was stopped for a broken taillight. Mr. Kelly said there was “more than the reason for the equipment violation” to pull Mr. Castile over, but would not specify what those other reasons might have been. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is investigating the case, has released few details. The bureau has confirmed that the episode started as a traffic stop by Officer Yanez and a colleague near the state fairgrounds in Falcon Heights, a suburb patrolled by the St. Anthony Police Department. Mr. Castile died at a hospital shortly after the shooting. The bureau said a weapon was recovered at the scene. Gov. Mark Dayton, who has met with protesters and black leaders, has expressed sympathy for the Castile family and concerns about the role of race in the shooting, infuriating some in law enforcement. “Would this have happened if those passengers  —   the driver and the passengers  —   were white?” Mr. Dayton asked on Thursday. “I don’t think it would’ve. ” Protesters have gathered outside the governor’s residence in St. Paul since shortly after the shooting, and many have framed it as yet another episode of a black man being unjustly gunned down by a police officer. On Friday night, a sizable, racially diverse crowd gathered outside the governor’s mansion, where they had decorated the street with chalk messages like “This needs to end!” and “Justice 4 MN. ” The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has provided no timeline for when its investigation would be finished, though many expect it to take weeks or months. At that point, the case will go to the Ramsey County prosecutor, who can either decide on charges himself or present the evidence to a grand jury. Mr. Kelly said Officer Yanez had cooperated with investigators, providing informal information immediately after the shooting and giving a full statement within about 15 hours. “He’s very distressed about this incident, and he feels badly for the family of Philando Castile,” Mr. Kelly said. “It’s a tragic incident. ”",Q1Z2017-01-18Z1Q
Breitbart,Q1ZMatthew Boyle,"Q1ZDonald Trump Gambles Big, Skipping CPAC To Campaign In Kansas - Breitbart","Q1ZNATIONAL HARBOR, Maryland  —   Donald Trump’s decision to skip the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) here —  a major gamble, and potentially a huge mistake —  comes right as he’s aiming to unite conservatives   behind his campaign. [This move may jeopardize potential unity soon in the movement, even as signs of people getting behind him were beginning to show here.  “He spoke before I was chairman and the crowd always loves him,” American Conservative Union (ACU) chairman Matt Schlapp said in an interview with Breitbart News before Trump canceled. “He didn’t do great in the straw poll last year. My guess is he’ll do really well in the straw poll this year. ” Schlapp was even at that point defending Trump from former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee who did appear at CPAC. “I think it’s a pivotal moment,” Schlapp told Breitbart News when asked about the importance of CPAC as it relates to the presidential campaign. I don’t know whether there’s weeks or months left in this race, before we really have a consensus nominee. But it’s time for everybody to do everything they can to get their candidate. Waiting seems unwise. I saw what Gov. Romney did today and I thought if you felt that much passion about this, you know Donald Trump’s the same guy as he was the day he got into this race. Nobody took him seriously. I think they thought he would just fall away but I think they’ve seen the opposite. I think the message they’ve taken from voters is now it’s a big threat they now have to stop. Part of me says great, go for it —  this is America, do what you believe and leave it all on the field. Part of my brain says why? What’s the rationale for this. Trump announced —  as did CPAC, which is hosted by the ACU just outside Washington, D. C. annually —  on Friday morning that he’s pulling out of the event. The announcement came after a contentious debate in Detroit on Thursday evening. The exchange on   visas had him rattled, and saying on stage that he’s “changed” his viewpoint on the matter. After the debate, Trump blasted out a press release stating that he hadn’t changed his viewpoint. CPAC Tweeted on Friday that they are “very disappointed” Trump “has decided at the last minute to drop out of” the event. “His choice sends a clear message to conservatives,” the conference Tweeted. Very disappointed @realDonaldTrump has decided at the last minute to drop out of #CPAC  —   his choice sends a clear message to conservatives.  —   CPAC (@CPAC) March 4, 2016,  Trump’s campaign also issued a statement, saying he’s instead focusing on shoring up votes ahead of the Kansas caucuses on Saturday by holding a rally in Wichita. The Donald J. Trump for President Campaign has just announced it will be in Witchita, Kanasas for a major rally on Saturday prior to Caucus,” the Trump campaign said. “He will also be speaking at the Kansas Caucus and then departing for Orlando, Florida and a crowd of approximately 20, 000 people or more. Because of this, he will not be able to speak at CPAC as he has done for many consecutive years. Mr. Trump would like to thank Matt Schlapp and all of the executives at CPAC and looks forward to returning to next year, hopefully as President of the United States. Newt Gingrich, a 2012 GOP presidential candidate and the former U. S. House Speaker, said on Twitter that Trump was “right. ” “Trump was right to skip CPAC,” Gingrich said. “The votes are in Kansas not Washington. Why give the   activists a target. ” Trump was right to skip CPAC. The votes are in Kansas not Washington. Why give the   activists a target,  —   Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) March 4, 2016,  While Gingrich might be right about that point about where the votes are, Trump   at the largest annual conservative movement event —  one Ronald Reagan, the former president, attended 13 times —  may hurt his ability to unite that movement behind his campaign, something he made clear he knows he has to do to win the general election during his   Tuesday press conference. Since Trump is and always has been a brute force populist nationalist —  and not a movement conservative —  the crowd that gathers here at CPAC from the traditional conservative movement has naturally been skeptical of his political rise. Sens. Ted Cruz ( ) and Marco Rubio ( ) Trump’s chief competitors, are both appearing here as is Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Each of them has sought to spread and push that skepticism of Trump’s nationalism among movement conservatives in 2016, probably one of the biggest obstacles holding Trump back from total and complete domination in elections. Trump supporter Carl Higbie, who appears on television and radio on Trump’s behalf regularly, told Breitbart News the night before Trump announced he’s skipping CPAC that he thought Trump’s speech here should emulate the gracious and humble press conference he gave after his big night on Super Tuesday. “I think if we saw another speech much like the one he just gave after Super Tuesday —  if we see that level of presidential unity and that type of presidential behavior from Mr. Trump, I think he’s going to start winning over some of the establishment guys,” Higbie said. “And I think it’s already starting a little bit. ” It certainly is. Trump has won endorsements from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) Rep. Duncan Hunter ( ) Rep. Chris Collins ( ) Maine Gov. Paul LePage, and former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. What’s more, several other major GOP players have started sounding a lot like they’re open to him. “Oh absolutely,” Rep. Marsha Blackburn ( ) a powerful and connected conservative congresswoman who is heading the select committee investigating Planned Parenthood, told Breitbart News here when asked if Americans’ anger at Washington is justified. “I talked about that in my speech. I call this righteous anger. I think we can look at Jesus throwing over the tables in the templet and say this is what people are feeling: Righteous anger. They are sick of special interests taking control of Washington, D. C. They love their country too much so they’re fighting back. ” Trump just won Blackburn’s Tennessee on Super Tuesday, and she told Breitbart News that the key takeaway from Trump’s victory and Cruz’s   finish is that “it’s an outsider year. ” “People are looking for somebody who’s not going to go along to get along,” Blackburn said. “They’re looking for someone who’s going to care for the Constitution more than they’re going to care for personalities. ” Blackburn added that “sure, absolutely” the Republican Party will get behind Trump if he wins the nomination. “I think so,” Blackburn said. “I think you’re going to have some people who they just don’t like him, and they’re not going to support him, but by and large people are going to support Donald Trump if he’s the nominee. ” Blackburn added that “absolutely” the same goes for Cruz, Kasich or Rubio. Rep. Jim Jordan ( ) the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus which led the way in removing John Boehner from the Speakership and has been a change agent in the House, told Breitbart News similarly that the electorate is justifiably upset at lackluster   in Washington. “It’s one of the reasons we created the Freedom Caucus,” Jordan told Breitbart News here. Because we feel like there are a countless number of Americans who feel like Washington has forgotten them. In the Freedom Caucus, our goal every day is to figure out how we can be effective fighting for those families who feel like they’re forgotten and to do what we told the voters we were going to do. So, yes, there’s a frustration out there and we feel that on the inside as well. So we formed this so we can better do what we told the voters we were going to do. So yeah, it’s real. You’re feeling it in this race. But I also think the approximately 40 members of the Freedom Caucus, their constituents know they are fighting to do what they said they would do. I think voters respect that with those members. Sen. Ron Johnson ( ) an outsider himself who worked in business before his election to the U. S. Senate in 2010, told Breitbart News that what he’s looking for in GOP presidential candidates is an “agenda, a vision, for America in terms of who we’re going to get our economy moving. ” “The kind of economic security that feeds into national security,” Johnson said. Then hopefully they demonstrate to Republican primary voters how they would beat Hillary Clinton. It’s vital. This election is for all the marbles. The tragic passing of Justice Scalia, the vacancy on the court, this is for two branches of government —  this is for the presidency and this for the Supreme Court —  and we’ve got to maintain our majorities in both the House and the Senate. This is for all the marbles. Johnson, who chairs the Homeland Security committee in the U. S. Senate, told Breitbart News that the intense focus on national security and immigration matters in this presidential election —  which is thanks in large part to Trump —  is promising to him. “Absolutely, that’s the top priority of our committee,” Johnson, who’s up for   this cycle, said. “We’ve held 14 hearings on border security alone. We’ve published a   report on our findings and they’re not real cheery findings. Our border is completely insecure and it’s because on a bipartisan basis we have not made a commitment to secure the border. It’s going to be a top priority and a top issue in this campaign. ” Rep. Roger Williams ( ) who’s backing Cruz for president, told Breitbart News he’s looking for “a message of less government” from the presidential candidates here. “My platform is what I want them to talk about,” Williams said. “Lower taxes, less government, cut spending, defend your borders, stand with Israel. I want them to talk about the Constitution as it’s written. I want them to talk about the Bible, and how it’s helping them get through this. So I think that’s what they need to say and I hope that’s what they’re going to talk about. Of course, I’ve endorsed Sen. Cruz and that’s where he is on the issues. ” Williams said of Cruz that “he’s going to continue to talk about what he talks about,” which is how Cruz is a “true conservative and he’s going to do what the Constitution tells him to do. ” Williams added that while he thinks Cruz is the only candidate left who can beat Trump in the GOP primary, if Trump does end up winning everyone needs to get behind his campaign moving into the general election. “I think so,” Williams said when asked if Cruz’s victories in Texas, Oklahoma, and Alaska prove he’s the best suited to take on Trump, before adding:  But look, we have to support the person who wins. We can’t have another four years or eight years of Hillary Clinton. Are you kidding me? It would tear this country apart. I’m a Sen. Cruz man, but what I’m saying is he’s the only one —  and Donald Trump —  that can win states. I think Marco Rubio needs to probably take —  we got the 15th coming up. If he can’t win Florida, he needs to get out. If Kasich can’t win Ohio, he needs to get out and let the people decide on who’s the best to run our country. Rep. Ron DeSantis ( ) who’s currently running for the U. S. Senate seat Rubio will vacate at the end of this term thanks to Rubio’s presidential campaign, echoed Trump by saying the message the GOP candidates need to bring to CPAC is “energy, energy, energy. ” “We’ve had eight long years [of a Democrat president] and to add another four years to that, our country is going to be in such a hole so we have a chance to fight back and so we really have a chance to get our country back on the right track of limited government, the Constitution, individual initiative,” DeSantis said. “I’m hopeful. I think after eight years, I think the country is in the mood for something different. I think you’re seeing that out there with how many people are showing up in these Republican primaries. ” DeSantis, who is remaining neutral in the presidential race, said the discussion of “substantive ideas” like national security and immigration matters on the campaign trail is a good thing. The more you’re discussing substantive ideas, I mean one of the issues that’s been discussed in these debates is the ‘Gang of Eight’ bill,” DeSantis said of Rubio’s legislation. “I think that that’s good. I was very much opposed to that —  and a lot of conservatives were —  but those are things that I think need to be aired out. I think that there’s a lot of insults, there’s too many of those, but there has been some substantive discussions. DeSantis added that there is no doubt Donald Trump is currently leading big in Florida. I think if you look at the polls, Donald Trump I think has led in every poll in Florida for like the last three months,” DeSantis said. “I think he’s in the drivers’ seat and you have these other guys, Rubio and Cruz, who are going to have to show some voters that they need to break with them because I think as things are going right now, I think Trump has probably got a pretty solid lead throughout the state. I’m not a good prognosticator, but I will say in Florida people have already been voting early and if the narrative —  even if you start changing minds, there are already votes baked in the cake. It’s good to be leading three weeks out because you actually will bank votes three weeks out. Rep. John Fleming ( ) who’s running for U. S. Senate in Louisiana, told Breitbart News that “it’s just too early to be able to divine those things” when asked if the party will get behind Trump if he wins the nomination. “I’ll tell you that certainly I’ll consider getting behind whoever the nominee is, and I’m going to hold back until I know,” Fleming said. “But I do think we should come together as Republicans but also I think we need to listen to the American people. Obviously, they’re not up for the same old Republican establishment ideas and candidates. They want something new. ” Fleming said “I think it is” when asked if the process that’s playing out is healthy for the party and for conservatives. “I think it is very healthy —  that’s the whole point,” Fleming said. I think too much has been hidden from people in Washington. The establishment has been listening to the special interests and not to the people and they’re just now figuring that out —  the people across our country, our base. And they say “you know what, you guys never were listening to us, Republicans and Democrats, and it’s time to start listening. ” Fleming said that when Louisiana selects its candidate on Saturday, he doesn’t have any insights into what might happen other than that he expects an outsider to win.  I just think it’s going to be an outsider, whoever that is, because where everybody is coming from is the outside. But you know when it comes to the outside, I helped create the Freedom Caucus, and look at the change we brought. We tossed the Speaker of the House and we blocked the second in command from taking over. That’s what the American people want to hear from us. Whatever comes in 2016 in November, it’s going to have to do with people wanting change. It remains to be seen what the fallout from this is going to be. It’s unclear if this obvious but    movement in the conservative movement shift    towards Trump will continue after the CPAC snub. It’s also certainly possible that Trump   at CPAC doesn’t have any effect at all on it. “I think people are genuinely —  people are so pissed off —  and so frustrated, they just want someone to disrupt,” videographer James O’Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas —  which does undercover video investigations into bastions of big government —  told Breitbart News. I think people just want a disrupter. That’s why you’re seeing Trump and Cruz do so well. If you’re an establishment guy, you have to convince people you’ll lead disruption. It’s not even a ‘conservative’ thing. I don’t think these people necessarily make conservatism a priority. These people just want someone who’s going to shake things up. Some people say Trump is the opposite of liberty —  I don’t necessarily disagree. But he definitely is the opposite of Washington. So if you’re an establishment guy, you’ve got to find a way to channel the disruption. That’d be my advice —  if you don’t do that, you’re not going to win. “I really think that this is down to a two man race, Trump and Cruz, and I hope that these people let Marco Rubio and John Kasich know that they need to get out,” Dave Bossie, the head of Citizens United, added, noting that it’s unlikely to have a huge impact on Trump’s chances from here on out.",Q1Z2016-03-04Z1Q
CNN,Q1ZJoe Sutton,Q1ZRihanna to play iconic role in ’Bates Motel’,"Q1Z (CNN) Pop star Rihanna will be bringing her acting talents to the small screen when she takes on a key role in the final season of ”Bates Motel.” Her casting was revealed Friday at the   International convention in San Diego, where the cast and crew of the show held a panel discussion.  The show’s official Twitter account tweeted a video of the singer announcing the role. ”I am about to check into the Bates Motel very soon,” she said. ”Guess what else? Guess who’s playing Marion?” ”Bates Motel” is a prequel to the classic 1960 horror film ”Psycho,” directed by Alfred Hitchcock. In the movie, Marion Crane    played by the late actress Janet Leigh    meets her death in a bloody shower scene.   The TV series, which airs on the cable network AE, explores the relationship between Norman Bates and his mother Norma, who run the motel in the remote seaside town of White Pine Bay, Oregon. While Rihanna is best known for hit songs including ”Work,” ”Umbrella” and ”What’s My Name,” the    Barbadian also has a number of acting gigs under her belt, having appeared in films such as ”Battleship” and ”This is the End.” Her role in the fifth and final season of ”Bates Motel” will see her star alongside Vera Farmiga, Freddie Highmore, Max Thieriot, Olivia Cooke and Nestor Carbonell.",Q1Z2016-07-23Z1Q

Atlantic,Q1ZJames Fallows,"Q1ZWhy the Maker Movement Matters: Part 1, the Tools Revolution","Q1Z, I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. In the years when I was visiting and learning about factories in China, my dominant emotion was, I can’t wait to tell people about this! Of course everyone “knew,” in general terms, about the rise of Chinese manufacturing and the country’s role as    . But the experience of seeing the factories that turned out computers and smart phones and everything else was so different from hearing about “  Chinese sweatshops” that I thought, people really have no idea. Sure, low wages and    regulatory and environmental standards were big advantages. But it was mainly the speed of the industrial ecosystem in places like Shenzhen that was so amazing. And the density of all elements of the supply chain  —   if you needed a certain kind of keyboard or connector, there were five suppliers to choose from within an hour’s drive. And one more underappreciated element was essential: the new tools of connectivity and logistics that allowed a customer in Chicago to shop online for a smartphone, and have the customized specs conveyed instantly to a production line in China, where the order would be put together and then taken to the airport in Hong Kong for airfreight back to the U. S. These new tools really mattered: China had had low wages for a very long time (and they were beginning to rise fast in these factory zones) it had abused the environment for years (and was trying to clean up). But it was only the   of information and logistics that allowed Chinese factories to be so directly incorporated into the world    system. That’s the story I told nine years ago in “China Makes, The World Takes,” centered on a company that had pioneered this kind of connection. I have had a similar feeling in recent years as I’ve seen outposts of the “Maker Movement” across the United States: This matters! People should pay attention! In this and the next few dispatches I’ll explain why I think so, and give illustrations from Kentucky, Oregon, South Carolina, California, and elsewhere. I imagine that many readers might have heard of this movement or seen one of its Maker Faires. But my guess is that most people who aren’t directly involved think of it as fringe and      and hip rather than a serious economic, technological, and   force. I’ve come to disagree, and let me lay out some of the reasons why. First, the lay of the landscape: You can see information about the national Maker Faire cycle here, for information about shows and displays. The next big event on the calendar is the National Maker Faire, in DC two weeks from now. You can read here about MakerCon, which I’ve been to and enjoyed, and go here for Make: magazine, to which I subscribe. In two weeks the White House will have events for the National Week of Making, with more information here. Make: had a story on the Maker City Initiative here Peter Hirschberg has a speech explaining the concept here and the Institute for the Future had an early report here. Now, what this movement is and why it matters. Everyone who has heard a recent political speech, listened to a talk show, or looked at the “Made in China” labels in retail stores is familiar with the idea that “America doesn’t make things any more. ” There are obvious reasons, and some less obvious ones, why people feel this way. A certain kind of   production certainly has shifted from the rest of the world to China (and elsewhere) in the past generation. As economies get richer, the relative share of manufacturing in their output and their workforce inevitably goes down (as it does for farming —  even as absolute output in both categories keeps going up) because service sectors are growing faster. This is true even of economies which much more aggressive   industrial government policies and corporate practices, like Germany and Japan: And as manufacturing efficiency grows up, the share of manufacturing jobs goes down even faster than the output share. Everyone’s grandfather worked in a factory each generation, fewer do. So there is a real change —  fewer Americans have jobs in manufacturing —  that seems even larger than it is, because of the kinds of things America still makes. Consumers naturally mainly see consumer goods: TVs, electronics, gadgets, clothes. Those are the fields in which production has disproportionately shifted overseas. Walk into a WalMart or Costco, and just about everything seems to come from China. The   capital goods or scientific equipment from U. S. manufacturers rarely comes before our eyes. (The main exception is Boeing airplanes, with GE or Pratt  Whitney engines.) We see the “assembled in China” labels on Apple computers and phones and   what that means. The labels conceal the reality that the most valuable parts of a Mac or iPhone come not from China but from richer countries like Japan, Germany, South Korea, and very significantly from the United States. To wrap this up for now: yes, manufacturing is in relative decline across the developed world, although most Americans think the situation is worse than it really is. And yes, the decline of     manufacturing is part of the worsening pressure on   earners, also around the world. So anything that can spur new manufacturing is a plus —  with an emphasis on the new, given the repeated findings by the Kauffman Foundation that essentially all net job creation in the United States is from companies in their first few years of existence. (Explanation here. Short version: Older companies, in aggregate, gradually reduce their total workforce over time, as some go out of business and some get streamlined. Thus, the net job growth is from   companies.)   What might the maker movement have to do with that? It has made it surprisingly easier for new companies, in manufacturing, to start. Why? It has to do with tools. Here’s how I finally understood the difference that a new generation of production tools has made: by comparing it to my own business, writing and publishing. Everyone in journalism knows the line attributed to A. J. Liebling, in The New Yorker: “Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one. ” Liebling wrote that in 1960. As    recently as that in historical terms, if you wanted to disseminate your thoughts to people outside your household, you simply could not do it yourself. You had no option but to work through a limited number of powerful,   enterprises. You had to convince a newspaper or magazine to publish your writings —  because only they controlled the printing presses, delivery networks, and newsstands. (I remember the olden days of wanting to react to something in the news, and then making phone calls or sending letters —  ! !! yes, real letters in the mail on paper ! !! —  to the handful of gatekeepers who ran   pages, hoping you could get their interest.) You had to attract the attention of TV or radio reporters, since only they could get you on the air. If you had a longer story to tell, you had to convince a publishing house to put out your book. Short of going    with flyers, there was no way to avoid the middleman in this industry. And the people who served as middlemen —  the publishers, the broadcasters —  were buttressed by the very expensive printing and transmitting equipment they controlled. Wave after wave of disruption in publishing have been bad for everyone who used to hold that middleman role. (The Atlantic is doing very well right now —  so thanks for reading and subscribing!) But the new tools fostered an unprecedented outpouring of expression. Blogs, Tweets, YouTube videos, Instagrammed photos, podcasts, Reddit and Facebook communities, billions upon billions of daily texts messages   …     One by one many of these might be trivial and some of them destructive. But taken together they produced a totally different form of communication and knowledge, and countless millions of new business operations, all because an advance in production tools. There’s a similar   change whose effects are so profound that we never even think about them any more. In the early days of computer use and   if you wanted to write something electronically, you had to wrestle with a lot of the details of electronic life. The first computer I ever used, in the late 1970s, was one I bought from a   warehouse in Ohio I had to reprogram it to be able to use a writing program called The Electric Pencil. Now people may grumble about Word, Pages, and other programs, but using them requires about as much forethought as picking up a real pencil. In the early days of web design, to put anything online you had to know a lot about layout code. Including pictures, charts, videos, or sounds was so hard you generally didn’t bother. Now you copy an embed code, you click Share or Send or Upload, and the job is done. Tools that were unknown a generation ago are now ubiquitous and have changed everything about communication and expression. Something similar is fostering the maker movement. Since the dawn of the capitalist   era, to succeed in manufacturing you needed capital. You needed money for giant production equipment. Blast furnaces if you were making steel, assembly lines if you were making cars, machine tools if you were making engines, coordinated supply chains if you were assembling complex devices. Then you needed distribution arrangements with stores, and lots of inventory for them to keep in the warehouse, and other impediments that collectively made it hard, expensive,   and   for newcomers to enter a business. This is the equation that the tools revolution of the past few years is also changing for manufacturing. A combination of 3D printing (which allows people to make and revise prototypes onsite, and produce certain     items themselves, rather than going to a factory) much less expensive laser cutters, milling machines, and other sophisticated machine tools the evolution of Arduino controls, which allow designers to add sophisticated electronic functions without doing all the coding themselves. You could think of this last function as being similar to simple Embed functions for images or videos online. In parallel with these technological advances have been organizational changes. For instance, the rise of   and   site where people can use advanced machinery for free or at very low cost and the rise of collaborations among universities, community colleges, established companies, and local financiers in fostering hardware entrepreneurs. One of the most ambitions of those collaborative spaces is “Highway 1” in San Francisco. I wrote about its origins in the magazine back in 2012 you can read a report about its latest “Demo Day,” at which maker groups show off their products, in a TechCrunch story here and see a video here. This video from Highway 1 is obviously promotional, but it demonstrates the changes I am talking about and rings true to what I have seen and heard from entrepreneurs there (I have met and interviewed some of the people you see here). *** “This would not have been possible ten years ago,” Venkat Venkatakrishnan, the CEO of a unique and famous maker space called FirstBuild, told me in Louisville earlier this year. FirstBuild is unique because it was created by GE, as a subsidiary of its appliance division and as a deliberate effort to bring the nimble maker spirit to its design process. “What has changed is that the maker movement has figured out a group of technologies and tools which enable us to manufacture in low volume,” Venkat (as he is known) said. Big manufacturers like GE built their business on     very   production, where each new product means a bet of tens of millions of dollars. FirstBuild is mean to explore smaller, faster, more customizable options. “Now you can get a circuit board mill for $8, 000. If you are looking for a circuit board for an appliance, earlier the only chance of getting it was from China. Today I can make boards here and ship them out quickly. Similarly with laser cutters —  not big ones but small ones, where I can cut metal right here. It’s a huge advantage, and these things did not exist ten years from now. In those days you couldn’t hack the kind of creative solutions we are seeing now. ” Tomorrow FirstBuild and its parent GE Appliances division are expected to complete a   deal that will transfer ownership to the giant Chinese appliance maker Haier. (GE had previously planned to sell to the Swedish firm Electrolux, which has a much bigger presence in the U. S. market than Haier does, but it called off the deal last year after resistance from U. S.   regulators.) Both GE and Haier have said that that all factories and facilities will stay where they are (Electrolux had planned a move to its existing sites in North Carolina) that the GE Appliance and FirstBuild management will be unchanged and that the FirstBuild   mission will continue too. That’s the   corporate news. In the next installment, more details on exactly what FirstBuild has underway, how that parallels efforts in other parts of the country, and what this Maker energy might mean for the country’s ability to foster new companies and create better jobs.",Q1Z2016-06-05Z1Q
Fox News,Q1ZJoseph Weber,Q1ZGov or VP? Indiana’s Pence has Friday ballot deadline,"Q1Z Indiana Republicans are anticipating that Donald Trump will pick GOP Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate and purportedly have plans in place if Pence drops his   bid to become the vice presidential nominee, Indiana Republican sources tell FoxNews. com   The Trump campaign has suggested the VP announcement will be made at the national convention starting July 18 or in the coming days. However, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, will perhaps have to decide on Pence by noon Friday, the deadline for the   governor to appear on the state November ballot as either a gubernatorial or vice presidential candidate. The Indiana Republican Committee is apparently behind state Lt. Gov. Eric Holcomb, Pence’s gubernatorial   to become the nominee if Trump selects Pence, said the sources, who are familiar with the situation. The speculation around Trump perhaps having already decided on Pence is largely based on the two expected to appear together Tuesday at a rally in Westfield, Indiana, followed by a private fundraiser in Indianapolis. “Everyone here is acting as if it is happening and Pence is the pick,” Indiana Republican strategist Pete Seat told FoxNews. com on Saturday. “The speculation now, of course, is all about Tuesday. With the fundraiser here on Tuesday evening, one would think announcing it beforehand would bring in major dough. But then, 2016 has been one surprise after another. ” The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage → A GOP state committee member who asked for anonymity because he is not authorized to speak publicly on the issue said: ”Every indication that has been given to members of the   …     committee is that Pence getting picked is a very real possibility. ” Pence officials on Saturday again acknowledged last weekend’s meeting with Trump but referred additional questions about a VP selection to the Trump campaign. To be sure, Pence is not the only potential candidate being vetted by Trump, who in recent weeks has floated several names, held tryouts on the campaign trail and met privately with others, including Pence. Among those potentially on Trump’s short list, in addition to Pence, are New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie, Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions and former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. And in the past few days, there have been published reports about retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn being considered. Tennessee GOP Sen. Bob Corker appeared at a rally last week with Trump but has since withdrawn his name. Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst also met privately with Trump but has since suggested her focus is on helping her state through her work in Congress. Pence, who endorsed Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz for president, has tried to downplay the VP speculation by saying he’s focused on his   bid, but Democrats aren’t buying it. They point out that Pence previously had presidential ambitions of his own, though he ruled out a run last year after his approval rating slumped as a result of his handling of the state’s religious objections law. “Gov. Pence is wanting to move on,” said Pence’s November opponent, former Democratic state House Speaker John Gregg. “He’s created a mess, and he’s not wanting to clean it up.” Polls show Pence and Gregg essentially tied. Mike Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics, said picking Pence makes sense considering he’s a social conservative who would balance Trump and who has fundraising prowess and 12 years of experience in Congress. However, he also pointed out that Pence could get hammered in a White House race. “His legislative record was not that strong,” Downs said. “His time as governor has not been smooth and is easy to criticize, in spite of a number of successes. ” Though Holcomb appears to be a favorite among the state GOP establishment, the field of potential replacements if Pence is selected include such   lawmakers as Evansville Mayor Lloyd Winnecke, state House Speaker Brian Bosma and Reps. Susan Brooks and Todd Rokita    all Republicans. “The smart choice is the man who served one of the most beloved governors in the state’s history   …     somebody who could lead Indiana Republicans to historic gains across the state. That man is Eric Holcomb,” said GOP strategist Rob Burgess. Seat said the state GOP party is “blessed and cursed” with such a deep bench of talent, “meaning we find ourselves picking from a group of individuals that many states would fight over. ” However, he thinks that Holcomb, appointed to the lieutenant governor position a few months ago, has a “leg up” and acknowledges his “deep” relationships within the   state committee, considering he served as state chairman alongside many of the members.

Buzzfeed News,Q1ZCaroline O'Donovan,Q1Z Nextdoor Rolls Out Product Fix It Hopes Will Stem Racial Profiling,"Q1Z’For example, try to post about your car windows being smashed, and you’ll be prompted with this message:’ ’Try to describe someone with just a racial characteristic, and you’ll see this prompt, asking you to be more descriptive:’] Nextdoor, a   social network for neighbors that has more than 10 million registered users, is rolling out a new tool today that the company says has reduced incidents of racial profiling on its network by 75% during tests. In recent years, so many people have used Nextdoor to report things like black men driving cars or hispanic women knocking on doors as suspicious or even criminal that the site has become known as a hub for racial profiling. The new tool, an algorithmic form for reporting crime and safety issues, has been in beta for an   portion of Nextdoor’s 108, 000 neighborhood groups since May. This feature, which automatically identifies racially coded terms and prevents users from posting without supplemental descriptors, goes live for all users today. “The impact of being racially profiled in general is terrible,” CEO Nirav Tolia told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday. “It runs counter to the mission of Nextdoor. It’s something we feel morally obligated to take seriously. ” Racial profiling became an issue for Nextdoor in 2015, when a number of news outlets reported on the frequency of posts about crime or suspicious behavior that mentioned an individual’s race, but little or nothing related to actual criminal activity. In many cases, these posts would refer to people of color doing things such as talking on the phone or walking a dog. Tolia said it wasn’t the bad press, but the work of civic groups in Oakland that brought the issue to his attention. Nextdoor touts its collaborations with police departments, city governments, and other public agencies. Last fall, Oakland Vice Mayor Annie Campbell Washington encouraged Oakland city departments to stop using the app to communicate with citizens until Nextdoor addressed the issue of racial profiling. By October, Tolia’s team was holding working groups with advocacy groups and city officials, and together they came up with a solution. The idea, which Tolia credits to members of a group called Neighbors for Racial Justice, was to change the way crime and safety issues are reported on Nextdoor. Instead of a blank text box and subject line, it was suggested that Nextdoor design a form that more closely resembles a police report or 911 dispatcher questionnaire. By explicitly requesting details about height, clothing, and age, they would discourage people filing reports from focusing exclusively on the race or ethnicity of the subject. Nextdoor features a wide variety of post categories  —   Classifieds, Events, etc.  —   but it’s the Crime and Safety section where people tend to focus on race to the exclusion of other salient details. As of today, Nextdoor neighbors posting a “crime” or “suspicious behavior” to the site will be warned against allowing an individual’s race to color their interpretation of events. And if their post focuses too much on the race or ethnicity of the subject, they’ll be prevented from publishing it. “When race is invoked, we create a higher bar,” Tolia explained. Nextdoor claims this new   system has, so far, reduced instances of racial profiling by 75%. It’s also decreased considerably the number of notes about crime and safety. During testing, the number of crime and safety issue reports abandoned before being published rose by 50%. “It’s a fairly significant dropoff,” said Tolia, “but we believe that, for Nextdoor, quality is more important than quantity. ” Vice Mayor Washington said she’s “thrilled” with the results Nextdoor has achieved. “I don’t think a lot of technology companies would have taken the steps they did, and made significant changes to their platform,” she said. When tech companies come under fire for failing to take race issues seriously  —   Snapchat, Twitter, and Airbnb are examples  —   critics often assert that, were minorities better represented on the staffs of those companies, the same mistakes might not have been made. But Tolia, who himself identifies as a person of color, said that while he’s working actively to diversify Nextdoor’s staff, when it comes to racial profiling, “we believe we get the best information from our members, and in this case, our advisers. ” But not all of Nextdoor’s advisers on the racial profiling project are satisfied with how the process turned out. Two founding members of Neighbors for Racial Justice, Audrey Williams and Shikira Porter, said Nextdoor left them out of the development process after a flurry of early interest. Porter told BuzzFeed News that she continues to see instances of racial profiling in her Nextdoor neighborhood despite the rollout of the form. Nextdoor confirmed that the company has not met with Neighbors for Racial Justice since the test pilot began in April, but said it was made aware of only two instances of racial profiling that had slipped through its algorithms in the last few months. “We’ve been doing the work of consultants for them, and they’ve been taking it as free,   volunteer advice from the community,”said Williams, who works in digital marketing. “And we’ve been happy to give it, because it makes our lives better. But over time, it began to feel a bit like exploitation. ” Nextdoor will hold a conference call for local stakeholders on Wednesday, but neither Williams nor Porter will be able to attend. Porter said it “didn’t feel right” to have Neighbors for Racial Justice attached to a project they felt the organization hadn’t been given a chance to sign off on. “We appreciate working with [Neighbors for Racial Justice] to create these improvements,” said Tolia in a   email. “We are encouraged by the progress, but know there is still more work to do. ” However, it’s clear that the contributions of Neighbors for Racial Justice and other local organizations to Nextdoor’s efforts were integral to the design and execution of the final product. Some of the copy Nextdoor ended up using in the form  —   such as, “Ask yourself, ‘Is what I saw actually suspicious, if I take race or ethnicity out of the question? ’”  —   came at the suggestion of Neighbors for Racial Justice. The new racial profiling form isn’t the only change Nextdoor has made in service of tempering racial profiling on its platform. Last November, the company introduced a checkbox that allows users to flag posts for racial profiling. More recently, it’s trained the group of   customer service representatives that reviews such posts in conflict resolution and “cultural humility” with an eye towards helping users understand why their posts were flagged, and how racial profiling negatively impacts whole communities. It’s unusual for a tech company to take such an active role in policing its users, or to make an investment in educating them about social and cultural issues. In addition to relying on community members, Nextdoor also hired consultants to help, among other things, define what racial profiling outside of a police setting even is. Debo Adegbile, a civil rights attorney with the NAACP who was nominated for US assistant attorney general by President Obama, and Grande Lum, a race relations expert with the Department of Justice, both worked as advisers to Nextdoor. Because the new form makes it less likely that users will post to Nextdoor, Tolia said there’s a “business cost to doing this. ” But given the way Airbnb, Twitter, and other tech companies have struggled with issues of race in recent months, it’s easy to see Tolia’s decision to meet the racial profiling problem   not just as morality, but also as good business sense. “Let’s not be fooled,” said Audrey Williams of Neighbors for Racial Justice. “It’s a win for us, and it’s a win for them. ”  ",Q1Z2016-09-01Z1Q
National Review,Q1ZAlexandra DeSanctis,Q1ZHuman Rights Watch’s Alarmist Stance toward Trump,"Q1ZHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has apparently decided that incoming president Donald J. Trump is a threat to American civil liberties. In a summary of its 2017 world report released last week, the organization berates Trump for “float[ing] proposals that would harm millions of people, including plans to engage in massive deportations of immigrants, to curtail women’s rights and media freedoms, and to use torture” during his presidential campaign. In its full report, HRW argues that the policies Trump embraced on the stump “would cause tremendous harm to vulnerable communities, contravene the United States’ core human rights obligations, or both. ” The logic behind HRW’s warnings is flimsy. The U. S. the group suggests, is a potential abuser of basic human rights because under Trump the federal government might . . . enact a conservative rather than progressive model of health care. As evidence, the group notes Trump’s promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and “nominate ‘ ’ Supreme Court justices who would ‘automatically overturn Roe v. Wade, which would allow individual states to criminalize abortion. ” In the report’s estimation, it seems, repealing Obamacare and protecting unborn life amounts to the abuse of human rights. It might be easier to take HRW seriously if the group had a better track record of critiquing actual   abuses. Specifically, the group would do well to cease ignoring the ongoing terrorist attacks against Israel, and to refrain from blaming the country for enforcing “severe and discriminatory restrictions on Palestinians’ human rights. ” Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, and yet HRW considers it to be a violator of human rights and blames it, in large part, for the ongoing conflict with Palestine. HRW’s unmistakable bias against Israel and clear preference for aggressively   policies are just two examples of its skewed perspective on what constitutes a human right. Trump’s rhetoric and policy proposals were just that: rhetoric and proposals. He hasn’t yet taken office, and we have little idea what kind of president he’ll be. For now, it’s hard to take seriously claims that the freedom as we know it is in danger from a group with such a perverted view of the world.,",Q1Z2017-01-17Z1Q
New York Post,Q1ZMarc Berman,Q1ZPorzingis was dropping weight fast — but found breakfast cure,"Q1ZCHARLOTTE, N. C.  —   Kristaps Porzingis realized he would shrink to nothing if he didn’t take the Knicks’ new dietitian’s advice and inhale a   breakfast. The   Knicks    rookie added 11 pounds from the end of July’s summer league to the start of training camp, but Porzingis started to gradually drop weight as the regular season rolled on and his minutes increased. After going from 227 to 238 pounds over the summer, Porzingis dropped to 233 by December. “Now I’m maintaining it,’’ Porzingis told The Post on Saturday. “I lost a little bit at the beginning of the season. It was hard to maintain that, but I’ve been staying at the same weight and I got to maintain this weight for sure. Once the season is over, I’ll try to get up to 245 pounds for next season. ’’ Knicks coach Derek Fisher has cited subtle changes in the Knicks training staff in aiding the team’s return to health this season after an   wreck that was  . One indicator is Porzingis playing in all 46 games, a surprise that is a credit to a medical staff led by Dr. Lisa Callahan. In part, Callahan brought in new dietitian Erika Whitman, who advised Porzingis to go full bore at breakfast as his weight declined, and to go to bed earlier. “I didn’t pay as much attention in the beginning of the season to breakfast,’’ Porzingis said. “I wanted to get to the gym. I’d eat something quick and go to work out. So now I’m getting up one hour, 1½ hours earlier and having a big breakfast so I have energy for the whole day. I’m really focusing on breakfast. ’’ Porzingis’ breakfast fare isn’t anything outlandish  —   just large portions. It helps that his parents have lived with their    son most of his rookie season in White Plains, and his mother, Ingrida, is a noted former hoopster and cook. His parents are staying until March. “A lot of cottage cheese with fruit, then eggs, ham, toast,’’ Porzingis said. “It’s kind of like an American breakfast, but Latvian style. It’s a big meal. I don’t think other people have big breakfasts like me. “[The Knicks] wanted me to have big breakfasts, but I’m really pushing myself to eat, even when I’m not hungry, so I can have a lot of energy for the day. ’’ The Knicks’ research before the draft showed Porzingis was susceptible to anemia  —   a condition in which the blood doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells. He contracted anemia as a    when he was in the minor division of the Spanish League, because he wasn’t eating right. Porzingis said he now carries iron pills on all road trips and hasn’t developed a pronounced case since. “I was so weak and sleepy because of the blood  —   I wasn’t eating enough,’’ Porzingis said. “Food changed from Lativan food to Spanish food and I couldn’t adjust. I was working out a lot, [had] a growing body and I got anemia. I have a few moments when my iron levels are low, I get sleepy and as soon as that happens, I take my iron pills and I’m fine. ’’ Porzingis, who clearly doesn’t want to miss a game, recently has played through a shoulder injury and a bruised foot, but some nights he’s a lot more lively than others. Porzingis revealed he played for a week with jammed index fingers on each hand that swelled up, but have since healed. Sources say his family is shocked he’s been able to battle through the ailments without missing a single game, keeping his Rookie of the Year candidacy alive. Porzingis has said he is trying to prove wrong the “durability police’’  —   the ones who suggested he would be   after missing three games in preseason. “I think [my family] knows I’m able to play though pain,’’ said Porzingis, who is averaging 14 points, 7. 8 rebounds and 2. 0 blocks while shooting 43 percent. “There’s a lot of stuff going on. That’s why I think they’re surprised. I want to [play all 82 games]. I’m really pushing myself through all the little injuries, little things I have going on. I want to stay strong mentally and play through it and have a complete season. I think physically this is my first year, I’m trying to figure out how to keep stay fresh for every game. ’’ The Knicks declined to make Whitman, the dietitian, available for comment. Even at 233 pounds, Fisher said Porzingis is fine for his rookie year. “He’s put on the amount of weight that’s good for where he is now,’’ Fisher said. “It’s always hard to hold or gain weight during the season because of the workload and how much energy you expend. It’s proportionate to your overall strength in terms of how much weight he can carry and strength ratio. He’s 20 years old, and as he physically matures, he’ll gain weight naturally.   …     We’ll try to do what we need to do this summer. ’’ Carmelo Anthony, who has missed four games and complained of a sore left knee Saturday, is no guarantee to play Tuesday against the Thunder at the Garden.",Q1Z2016-01-25Z1Q
Guardian,Q1ZGuardian sport,Q1ZLeBron James attacks travel ban: ’This does not represent the US’,"Q1ZLeBron James has become the   athlete to speak out against Donald Trump’s immigration policy, which is currently being fought over in court. The Cleveland Cavaliers star spoke to the Hollywood Reporter after he received the NAACP’s Jackie Robinson Award earlier this month. “I am not in favor of this policy or any policy that divides and excludes people,” James said. “I stand with the many, many Americans who believe this does not represent what the United States is all about. And we should continue to speak out about it. ” James has spoken about social issues before. Last year he appeared at the ESPYs and called for an end to gun violence and racial profiling, while in 2014 he appeared in an “I can’t breathe’   to pay tribute to Eric Garner, who died after an encounter with New York police.  In the interview with the Hollywood Reporter, James emphasized that he believed in peaceful protest. “Diversity is what makes this country so great,” said James. “We should all continue to speak up and fight for ideas that bring people together regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, religious beliefs or any other differences. ” Prominent figures in the NBA have spoken out about the travel ban. The league has several   Muslim players as well as representatives from more than 30 countries. “I think [the policy] is shocking. It’s a horrible idea,” the Golden State Warriors coach, Steve Kerr, said last month. “I feel for all the people that are affected. Families are being torn apart, and I worry in the big picture what this means to the security of the world. It’s going about it completely opposite. You want to solve terror, you want to solve crime, this is not the way to do it. ” Perhaps the only other US athletes in the major professional leagues who can rival James’s fame is the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. In contrast to James, Brady has spoken of his friendship with Trump but has refused to be drawn into a discussion of his policies. At least two of Brady’s   have said they will not attend the White House to celebrate the Patriots’ recent Super Bowl victory. ",Q1Z2017-02-08Z1Q
NPR,Q1ZAlina Selyukh,"Q1ZPostelection, Overwhelmed Facebook Users Unfriend, Cut Back","Q1ZRachael Garrity posted a farewell message on Facebook. She told her ”friends”  —   that’s how she puts it in an email to NPR, in quotes  —   that she would delete her account. An email from her son followed: Are you OK? ”I am finding Facebook to have a negative impact on my continuing to keep a positive feeling regarding some of the people I have known longest and cherish most,” writes Garrity, who has worked in    marketing and publishing since the 1970s. Garrity was one of more than 150 people who have shared their stories with NPR, recapping how they are recalibrating their attitude toward social media after this year’s election. Donald Trump’s surprise victory ended an emotional   of a presidential race, which has left Facebook, Google and Twitter scrambling to rein in a proliferation of fake news and harassing behavior. ”What was really shocking to me was how many people who I consider to be smart were sharing things that were not so smart, definitely obviously fake but matched whatever viewpoint that they pushed or agreed with,” says Michael Lowder. He’s Garrity’s grandson  —   and he shared her story with NPR because, true to her word, she has quit Facebook, where NPR posted the  . As for himself, Lowder has no plans to abandon social media, and a few people wrote in to say they are actually doubling down, regretting not speaking out more before the election, or feeling freed to speak their minds now that Trump is   or finding support in   communities. But the vast majority of emails  —   some of them nearing 1, 000 words in length  —   read like testimonials to a therapist: I’m having a hard time focusing. I have questioned my friendships. I can’t stop scrolling. I’m exhausted. One email to NPR ended with: ”It was good to get that off my chest.” People are turning off TVs (one even canceled her cable  —   mass media are not off the hook, either) deleting social apps from their phones, rationing time spent on Facebook and Twitter, and shrinking their digital friend lists. Facebook is a source of news for a majority of American adults, but in the vitriol and propaganda of the 2016 election, its proverbial public square for many users has devolved into a     debate  —   or an omnipresent Speakers’ Corner. As Lowder says his father put it, opining on social media is the equivalent of shouting off a soapbox in the street: a declaration, rather than discussion. This view, of course, cuts against the way Facebook views itself. ”Friends and family come first” was said to be its guiding value in a shakeup of the news feed algorithm revealed in June. Susan Brubaker Knapp from Mooresville, N. C. writes: ”The day after the election, the hate and darkness got to be too much. I unfriended nearly everyone. Now I have three friends: my husband and children. . .. I do hold (Facebook) responsible for helping to spread disinformation that contributed to both the election results and the level of vitriol and hate in this country. I am building my own wall now.” A similar sentiment from Todd Neigum: ”(The election) simply turned me off of Facebook. I started by unfollowing people I’ve known for 40 years. Neighbors, friends, family doesn’t mean I have to wade through untold numbers of gloating, trashtalking, flamethrowing posts.” Much of the consternation does come from supporters of Hillary Clinton, who find themselves inundated and overwhelmed by news about a candidate they oppose. But then there are people like Tin Samuel, a tech consultant from Kansas City, Mo. who did vote for Trump. Back in 2015, Samuel set up a second profile, splitting his closest connections from more professional ones, theoretically carving out a space to comfortably express his opinion. It hasn’t worked out that way, he writes, as people who disagree with him ”lob insults” and he has found he’s censoring himself on both profiles: ”It’s not just strangers that are engaging in this kind of behavior. It’s people I’ve known for 20 years. . .. It’s one thing when you’re insulted by a stranger on an NPR or CNN newsfeed. It’s quite another when you’re being threatened by someone who knows where you live. . .. ”For the rest of the year at least, I’m going to stop talking about politics altogether online, and focus on the topics and things that I find more interesting. Technology, silly cat memes, Brazilian dance music, and food videos. You know, all that stuff the internet was always supposed to be about to begin with.” And actually, a few people have reported creating a dual presence on the platform, turning to a new profile void of political pages and opinionated friends or family. Writes health care worker Jackie Prack from Greenville, S. C.: ”The election was the last straw for me. In the days after, all I saw was hate. From both sides. . .. I decided that day to get rid of my original Facebook and create my ’new’ Facebook . .. full of running, bikes, breweries, cat videos, satire, art, music, hiking, food, and good people. . .. If the world is falling apart, my head is solidly in the sand right now . .. and it’s nice down here.” Rationing of social media time has been a common response, too. Greg Jeffers, a teacher from Rowlett, Texas, describes himself as a ”deeply religious” person and a social conservative  —   he voted for Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer who is a Mormon. Jeffers says before the election, he obsessively shared ”every article I was reading on Facebook” and getting into arguments with friends and friends of friends, who as conservatives supported Trump. Unlike many users struggling to burst or embrace ideological bubbles formed on Facebook, Jeffers faced a different challenge: ”Since (Trump) won, I realized I would have at least four more years of being ideologically separated from my tribe. I also realized that I had become a meaner, more cynical person. . .. ”I decided not to totally delete Facebook. It really is a good way to stay in touch with people. But, I did decide to have my wife change my password. And I decided that I would allow myself an hour a week (30 minutes on Saturday and 30 minutes on Tuesday or Wednesday) to peruse Facebook and stay caught up.” Jeffers writes that he’s thinking of shifting his time from Facebook arguments to something practical, spending time with his wife and daughters, his students, his church family. ”Maybe I can, through my church, teach ESL to refugees,” he writes. And then there’s Emily Prymula from Wadsworth, Ill. who says, in her rebound from social media overdose, she began researching how to run for local elected office: ”I can’t make a difference or change someone’s opinion through a Facebook discussion, but I can do so through being present in my community.” She describes herself as an independent, which she says turned her news feed into an ”ideological battleground”: ”Facebook felt like a summit on a frustrating,   illness, all of my friends doctors of their own dogma, trying to convince one another that their preferred course of treatment had less severe side effects and a better   outcome for the patient. . .. I turned off my notifications, and vowed to only post positive news about my life for my family and friends.” Monica Eskin makes an interesting observation: ”There is a reason that voting is anonymous: so it doesn’t destroy your ability to live with your neighbors. As their neighbor I know less about them than I do as their (Facebook) friend, and maybe that’s the way it is supposed to be with your neighbors and coworkers, etc.” But of course, many emails make the  : ”Let’s be honest, most political conversation happens on social media these days . .. for better or for worse,” writes Carmen Jenkins, who describes herself as a moderate,     Republican. ”If I want to have a voice in this conversation, I better engage,” she says. ”I better engage in a way that promotes dialogue rather than shutting it down with judgments and generalizations.” How effective Jenkins and others like her will be just might determine how social media shapes up (is it too soon to say this?) for the next election.",Q1Z2016-11-20Z1Q
Reuters,Q1ZAhmed Rasheed and Saif Hameed,Q1ZIraq searching for three U.S. citizens reportedly abducted,"Q1Z Security forces in Baghdad were hunting for three U. S. citizens who Iraqi lawmakers said on Monday had been kidnapped, which, if confirmed, would make them the first Americans abducted in the country since U. S. troops withdrew in 2011. Unknown gunmen seized the trio from a private apartment on Friday in the capital’s southeastern Dora district, said Mohammed   who sits on parliament’s security and defense panel. It was not immediately clear if their motives were political or criminal. Iskandar Witwit, deputy head of the same panel, gave a similar account citing senior security officials who said the civilians had been taken from the district’s Sihha residential complex. Two of the three also had Iraqi citizenship, he said.   Shi’ite Muslim militia fighters, seen as a bulwark in the fight against Islamic State militants, have a heavy presence in that part of the predominately Sunni district. The three men work for a small company that is doing maintenance work for the information technology division of General Dynamics Corp, under a larger contract with the U. S. Army, according to a source familiar with the matter.  The names of two of the men, which were first published by Fox News and other media outlets, are Wael   (whose name is also spelled, Wael  ) and Amro Mohammed, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The spelling of the first man’s name was not consistent in information provided by authorities, said the source.    The name of the third man was not immediately available. Mark Meudt, a spokesman for General Dynamics, referred all queries to the U. S. State Department. The State Department on Sunday had it was working with Iraqi authorities to locate Americans reported missing, without confirming they had been kidnapped. A State Department spokeswoman on Monday declined to provide any further comment, citing ”privacy considerations.”  Dora was a bastion of the insurgency against the 2003 U. S.  invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein and the site of intense sectarian bloodletting that peaked around  . Federal police now run most checkpoints there. The capital of Iraq, OPEC’s second biggest oil exporter, has seen a proliferation in recent years of   criminal gangs that carry out contract killings, kidnappings and extortion. Iraqi police set up extra checkpoints in Dora on Monday and sent out helicopter search parties. Two Iraqi army helicopters were seen hovering over the district, while police vehicles patrolled the streets, residents said. The Iraqi government has struggled to rein in the Shi’ite militias, many of which fought the U. S. military following the 2003 invasion and have previously been accused of killing and abducting American nationals. Iraq has seen a series of abductions of foreign nationals in recent months. At least 26 Qatari hunters kidnapped last month in the southern desert by unknown militants have not yet been found. In September, 18 Turks taken in Baghdad by an armed group that used a Shi’ite Muslim slogan were released following several weeks in detention. The radical Sunni militants of Islamic State have maintained a limited presence in Baghdad, regularly claiming bomb attacks against Shi’ite neighborhoods.

Vox,Q1ZAndrew Prokop,"Q1ZThe state of the Republican presidential race, explained","Q1Z Is Donald Trump really going to be the Republican presidential nominee?    After his victories this week, this   outcome looks more likely than ever, and Republican elites are increasingly resigning themselves to it. But he hasn’t clinched it yet. Trump has built up such a lead in the delegate count at this point that he’s all but assured to finish with more delegates than any of his rivals. By our count, he has around 990 delegates, which places him very far ahead of Ted Cruz and John Kasich:         Indeed, both Cruz and Kasich have been mathematically eliminated from getting enough delegates to win on the convention’s first ballot, under the party’s current rules.    So the main drama now is not over whether Trump will get the most delegates, it’s about whether he’ll win an outright majority of delegates  —   1, 237, the magic number he needs to clinch the GOP nomination on the first ballot.    Right now, Trump has about 990 delegates. So he’s 247 or so away from the magic number, with 581 delegates still uncommitted or at stake in future primaries. The upshot is that Trump needs to win just 43 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch his majority.    But even if he falls a bit short of that majority, he now seems clearly on track to get very close to it. And the closer he gets, the more difficult it will be for the party to justify denying him the nomination. California and Indiana are the most important remaining states to watch The delegates that are still up for grabs fall into two main groups. There are about 500 delegates in the 10 states that haven’t voted yet, and then there are about 80 delegates who are uncommitted and free to support whomever they choose. The next state to vote is Indiana on this coming Tuesday, May 3, with 57 delegates at stake. In my view, this is the second most important state remaining, because it’s    (partly statewide, partly by congressional district) and has still seemed like it could tip to either Trump or Cruz. Most media commentators and politicos are interpreting Indiana as a   for Cruz at this point  —   if he loses it, his campaign will be deemed entirely dead rather than just mostly dead.    Four more states then vote in the remaining weeks of May. Of them, Nebraska is expected to give all its delegates to Cruz, West Virginia is expected to go strongly for Trump (though it has odd delegate allocation rules that could depress his total somewhat) and the candidates will split Oregon and Washington’s delegates due to proportional allocation. All this leads up to the final day of GOP primary voting: June 7, when five states will vote.   New Jersey is a    state that Trump is expected to win easily.  South Dakota and Montana are also    states, and are expected to go to Cruz.  New Mexico is another proportional state where the delegates will be split.  But the day’s biggest prize, and the state that will likely determine whether Trump clinches his majority, is California. There are 172 delegates at stake there, and 159 of them will be allotted    on the congressional district level (three delegates in each of the state’s 53 districts)  —   which means that broad strength across the state will be necessary to pick up most of its delegates. If Trump doesn’t manage to hit his magic number by June 7, however, he’ll still have some time before the   convention. And in the interim, he’ll work to win over those uncommitted delegates to try to get him over the top. (They’re from various states and territories due to quirks in local rules, including North Dakota, Pennsylvania, American Samoa, and Guam.) Trump could also try to peel some unbound delegates who have endorsed Cruz away from him, perhaps arguing that the party should avert a divisive and damaging contested convention. According to a tally by PhD student Daniel Nichanian, Cruz has 24 of these delegates. (Trump has been endorsed by 30 or so unbound delegates that could in theory defect from him, too.) Convention shenanigans to block Trump are possible theoretically but a tough sell practically So, you may be wondering, is the Republican Party really stuck with Donald Trump as its nominee? Can they really do nothing to stop him?    In fact, the 2, 472 delegates who go to the convention have a great deal of power  —   so much so that they probably could prevent Trump’s nomination if they really, really wanted to. The problem is that this would badly flout the modern norm that a party’s voters determine the party’s presidential nominee, and would cause a tremendous backlash  —   a backlash for which the party doesn’t appear to have an appetite. First of all, if Trump doesn’t lock down that majority of delegates on the first ballot, then he doesn’t become the nominee just yet. Multiple rounds of balloting will ensue, and more and more delegates will become freed up to vote for whomever they want. But what would happen after that isn’t clear. Many have argued that since Trump has done a bad job of ensuring his supporters are installed as his delegates, party support would surely swing elsewhere as a second ballot. Yet polling shows that Republican voters think the candidate with the most delegates from primary voting should get the nomination. So it’s possible that the delegates would be hesitant to defy what they perceive to be the public will to nominate the candidate who came in second or someone who didn’t run at all.            Second, even if Trump does get an apparent delegate majority before the convention, there are various ways the delegates could, theoretically, change that. Most of these would involve changing the convention’s rules to tip the balance against Trump, which the delegates are perfectly free to do should they so desire  —   they have a lot of power! Yet the delegates will know full well that the more they actually use these powers to sway the outcome, the greater the backlash they’ll provoke. If current trends continue, Trump will have won the most delegates in primaries, the most votes, the most states. If GOP delegates change the rules at the last minute to block his nomination, it will (accurately) appear that they were trying to ”steal” the election from Trump, and infuriate his many supporters.    Recent evidence has pointed toward the party starting to resign itself to the inevitability of a Trump nomination, rather than gearing up for an intensely controversial effort to block him:   Single biggest thing Trump has going for him now is this attitude taking hold in the party: https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) April 22, 2016    So that’s where we appear to be  —   Trump is doing well enough, and his rivals have been doing poorly enough, that while it’s still unclear whether he’ll get his delegate majority, it’s tougher than ever to imagine the Republican Party stopping him.

Washington Post,Q1ZJonathan O'Connell,"Q1ZDonald Trump, José Andrés and the death of a grand Washington restaurant","Q1Z     He called it Topo Atrio, his vision for a sumptuous hotel restaurant befitting a $200 million makeover of the Old Post Office Pavilion on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. José Andrés designed a      dining room clad in travertine limestone and trimmed in gold. Costing nearly $7 million to build, it would feature   cured ham from the   Iberico pigs of his native Spain and squid ink pasta with   red shrimp, cuttlefish and aioli. But as Andrés prepared to present his final plans, the man whose name would be on the new hotel, Donald Trump, had some business of his own. The billionaire developer took the stage at Trump Tower in New York to announce his candidacy for president and, in the process, railed against Mexican immigrants as drug dealers and rapists. Just over a week later, the chief executive at Andrés’s restaurant company picked up her iPhone and fired a quick message to Trump’s daughter Ivanka with the subject: We need to talk. “Getting crushed over DJT comments about Latinos and Mexicans. Need your help,” she wrote last summer. So began the end of what seemed a promising pairing of celebrity developer and internationally renowned chef, each hoping to trade on the other’s fame. Instead the two are suing each other, filling a court file with affidavits and correspondence chronicling what has become a stubborn standoff between two powerful personalities. Trump has taken a particular interest in the Old Post Office project, citing it on the campaign trail as a symbol of his business acumen and bragging it will be open when the nation is ready to inaugurate its next president. In the fallout over the restaurant deal, he wasted little time in personally seizing the more than $250, 000 Andrés’s company had set aside as collateral at the start of the project. The outspoken Trump has said little about the court fight, and he and company officials declined to comment for this story. Andrés and his team, too, declined comment on the ongoing legal matter, but the native of Spain who became a U. S. citizen in 2013 has not kept quiet about his opposition to candidate Trump. “Dear @MSNBC and @FOXTV why do you give so much live tv to somebody who is a racist, a divider? Somebody who doesn’t love USA, but himself? ,” Andrés tweeted in March. Still, court records show difficulties Andrés may face in court. The contract with Trump includes no morality clause that the chef could invoke to say he was harmed. And the agreement specifically excludes a trial by jury, saying that any dispute that lands in court must be decided by a judge. For now, Andrés’s attorneys are building a case around the damage that they say Trump’s comments had on the restaurant’s prospects, and the company has been busy surveying potential investors, patrons and employees of the restaurant to gauge the effect of Trump’s attacks on immigrants  —   and, in particular, Hispanics. Both sides appear to be digging in. As Trump said during a March news conference: “I don’t settle lawsuits  —   very rare  —   because once you settle lawsuits, everybody sues you. ”    José Andrés in his Minibar restaurant in Washington. He emailed the Trumps the day after a critical meeting was canceled. (AP   Martin, File)  D. C.’s ‘most exciting location’ When Andrés began serving   small plates on Seventh Street in 1993, there was no basketball arena downtown, Metro’s Green Line was only two years old and the neighborhood’s current moniker, Penn Quarter, had not been coined. The city’s restaurant boom was two decades off. Andrés built his empire with business partner Rob Wilder one restaurant at a time, adding Zaytinya, Oyamel, Beefsteak and others in the District, plus outposts in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami and Puerto Rico. Success in the kitchen advanced him as a television star, philanthropist and celebrity, one whom Time Magazine named one of the world’s most influential people in 2012. Andrés became one of the few international food stars distinct to Washington, his adopted home town, where he has a bar, food truck and seven area restaurants and has been lauded by officials for his investments and belief in the city. The chef’s stature in the District was attractive to the developer, whose sons and daughter handle    operations. Although they have hotels in five American cities and three foreign countries, the Trumps pride themselves on building getaways for their   guests that feel of and about the places they are in, even if they are all encased in the same shimmer and shine. To that end, the Trump International Hotel, Washington, D. C. is to feature large “presidential” suites, public access to the historic clock tower on the roof and a curated museum dedicated to the 19th century building and the Bells of Congress that hang above. Ivanka, who oversaw its development and who lived in Washington briefly while attending Georgetown University, has repeatedly talked about respecting the building’s historic place in the city even as she designed the spa and bathrooms trimmed in gold. “Anyone who is concerned about how we may alter or affect the historic character of the building can be assuaged by looking at our plans,” she said in 2012, seeking to reassure preservationists. “This isn’t, I think, a very polarizing concept. ” In search of a D. C. chef to match, the Trumps refrained from using their New York connections and hired a restaurant adviser, Bethesda, Md.  Streetsense, that they met through D. C. developer Douglas Jemal. Andrés was not the only big name in Washington they approached. Early on, the Trumps, according to executives familiar with the search, contacted Patrick O’Connell of the famed Inn at Little Washington in Rappahannock County, Va. about opening a D. C. flagship restaurant. Ultimately, Trump and his family settled on Andrés, agreeing to hand him the hotel’s marquee space, one to be built on a raised platform next to the hotel lobby. Court documents describe their agreement: The   lease  —   technically a sublease because the Trumps lease the building from the government  —   gave Andrés the    space for 10 years. Andrés agreed to pay $28, 750 a month for the first five years, $31, 625 a month for the next five, and would receive a cut of the profit. The Trumps would also pay for the chef’s likeness and promotional abilities, even in situations when he had little or no responsibility for cooking or preparing food. The main “Cortile Bar” would serve drinks and bar food featuring Andrés’s “culinary expertise,” although he would not operate it. In return, Andrés would get a 5 percent cut of food sales and a 4 percent cut of drink receipts. He also would get 5 percent of sales from a “José Andrés Banquet Menu. ” Andrés agreed not to open another hotel restaurant downtown. The chef outlined his concept for Topo Atrio in the contract with no shortage of romance: “Into the heart of Washington DC at the city’s newest, most luxurious and iconic hotel comes José Andrés’ own iconic, flagship restaurant  —   a modern, fine dining approach to the Spanish cuisine for which he’s internationally known. ”  For Andrés, the restaurant would be one of his biggest, and most expensive. He and Trump seemed happy with the deal. Trump issued a news release in December 2014: “We’ve tapped one of the very best in the field . . . to create a restaurant concept that will live up to the unrivaled offerings of what will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world. ” The chef tweeted a picture of himself enjoying a round of golf at Trump National Doral in Miami. Then, six months after the agreement, Trump began his run for president on June 16, launching a rhetorical war against immigrants with these comments: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. . . . They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. ”    Real estate developer Donald Trump walks with sons Eric Trump, left, and Donald Trump Jr. and daughter Ivanka Trump outside the Old Post Office Pavilion. Ivanka Trump tried to save Topo Atrio after her father’s comments on immigration. (Julia  )  An agreement sours Nine days passed before Kimberly Grant, chief executive of Andrés’ company, ThinkFoodGroup, emailed Ivanka Trump for help, according to an exchange filed as part of the legal case. Her message did not appear to surprise Donald Trump Jr. who wrote back after being forwarded the message: “Yes I was waiting for that one. ” The Trump executive assigned to developing the hotel, David Orowitz, voiced his frustration in an email contained in the public court file. At the time, the Trumps were hoping to open a year later, in June 2016. “Ugh. This is not surprising and would expect that this will not be the last we hear of it. At least for formal, prepared speeches, can someone vet going forward? Hopefully the Latino community does not organize against us more broadly in DC   across Trump properties. ” In typical hotel restaurant deals, the owner builds the restaurant and hires a chef to manage it. In this case the Trumps  —   who had agreed to spend $200 million on the project, far more than other bidders  —   negotiated a deal in which Andrés would pay to design and build his own restaurant. They wanted the chef to have skin in the game, and he agreed. Andrés, who had enlisted New York architect David Rockwell, has estimated building his share of the restaurant would cost $5. 4 million, which would require taking out a $3. 6 million commercial loan. By June of last year, ThinkFoodGroup estimated that it had spent more than $350, 000 on designs and plans, court records show. Marketing and design executives on both sides worked to advance the plans. After seeing the latest design, Trump’s interior designer, Giavona Pirolo emailed that Ivanka “really loved” the new presentation and offered some advice for presenting to Trump, or “DJT. ”     ThinkFoodGroup’s chief marketing officer, Michael Doneff, wrote back that Andrés approved of tweaks from the Trump side, as long as “we preserve the travertine and temper the shine. ” Before Trump announced his candidacy, a major design meeting had been scheduled for June 30, in which Andrés and Rockwell would present their latest vision in a large conference room on the 25th floor of Trump Tower in New York to Donald Trump, Ivanka, Don Jr. and other executives. Then came Donald Trump’s campaign remarks, and top executives on both sides sought to manage the fallout with their bosses. According to emails, Ivanka connected her father and the chef days before the planned meeting. Grant wrote her in appreciation:     Indeed, the afternoon before the meeting, the chef tweeted a lukewarm defense of the deal, writing that “as everybody knows don’t agree or support in any way or form with his comments. @thinkfoodgroup is just leasing a space in his hotel. ” But the star chef never appeared the next day and the meeting was canceled. The chef wrote Ivanka and Don Jr. the next morning:     Five days later, on July 6, Trump continued his broadside on immigration with another statement: “What can be simpler or more accurately stated? The Mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc. ” An online petition from D. C. resident Erick Sanchez urging Andrés to pull out received 2, 769 signatures in six days. While the names were still coming, Andrés sent The Washington Post a statement saying that the restaurant could no longer open and condemning Trump’s position on immigration: “I believe that every human being deserves respect, regardless of immigration status. ” ThinkFoodGroup wrote to the Trump Organization, saying that “Jose Andres’ success is built on an   call to the world to say ‘Welcome! Comemos! Enjoy!’ And we now have a landlord whose message is ‘Go home, criminals, and take your infectious diseases with you.’ ” In August of last year, Trump sued Andrés for $10 million. Calculating losses After Andrés countersued for $8 million, the two sides began fighting in court. Trump’s attorneys have tried to play down the presidential candidate’s role in the restaurant negotiations, saying that Don Jr. Ivanka and their brother Eric are responsible for the    management and operation of the Old Post Office project. On the campaign trail, Trump has offered a different impression. “I built an amazing company,” he said in March after Mitt Romney called his career into question. “And one of the reasons you know it’s amazing: The hottest development site, probably in the history of the General Services Administration . . . is the Old Post Office site . . . in Washington D. C. an entire block fronting on Pennsylvania Avenue. In other words, if I don’t get to the White House, I’m getting there anyway. ” It was also Trump himself who signed the lease with ThinkFoodGroup. And it is his signature on the document withdrawing $258, 171 ThinkFoodGroup had put up as collateral after the chef backed out, according to court filings.     Trump may also have to appear personally to respond to the fuss over his comments, as the judge in a parallel case, between the developer and chef Geoffrey Zakarian  —   who backed out of a lease for a second restaurant in the hotel  —   ordered Trump to make himself available in Washington to be deposed in that case. Attorneys have not taken depositions and the details probably will fall under court orders allowing some testimony to be kept secret. Andrés and his attorneys have constructed a lengthy argument that after the candidate’s comments, potential investors, employees and patrons of Topo Atrio  —   particularly Hispanic ones  —   would have steered clear of the restaurant, dooming it. Restaurant investor Todd Klein, who has backed 10 ThinkFoodGroup restaurants, submitted an affidavit saying that the comments “had the effect of eroding the establishment’s projected client base, which, in turn, increased the risk that the establishment would be unable to pay its debt. ” Other potential investors and ThinkFoodGroup’s banker, Robert P. Pincus of EagleBank, applauded the move. “Congratulations, Trump left TFG and Jose NO choice,” Pincus wrote in an email to the company. ThinkFoodGroup also tried to ascertain how many of its employees and patrons were Hispanic. After surveying 1, 215 employees at a dozen of its restaurants, it found that 51 percent were Hispanic. As of last summer, the company estimates that Hispanic patrons made 11 percent of online reservations at its restaurants, as well as 15 percent of online reservations at local Jaleo locations. ThinkFoodGroup has estimated that it would receive a profit of $1. 1 million over the first six years of operation. Removing 12 percent for its estimated Hispanic business, it calculated that Topo Atrio would instead lose a similar amount. “Trump should have known that his statements on immigration would have an adverse impact on the development of a Spanish   restaurant in a   building,” Andrés’s attorneys say in court documents. Worse, they suggested that “fine dining patrons eschew controversial sites,” which could have turned off diners of any ethnicity to his restaurants. D. C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) came to the chef’s defense, telling Ivanka that she did not want to see one of her local businesses bullied. “One of our business owners could be harmed in some dealings with the Trumps, which troubles me a lot,” Bowser said in an interview. “So we really would like them to resolve that. ” Trump’s attorneys argue the estimates are misleading and add that the candidate’s comments have no bearing on the lease. In documents that remain under seal, the Trumps also allege, according to two people familiar with the case, that Andrés may have had reservations before he pulled out. “They were frustrated with the design and construction process and behind generally on getting the documents done,” said one official familiar with the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is ongoing. Andrés’s attorneys deny the allegations in court filings. The evidence produced by ThinkFoodGroup “is as irrelevant as evidence of how many delegates or votes Mr. Trump has received in the Republican primaries,” Trump’s attorney told the court. Trump’s position on immigration, his attorney argued, wasn’t new and his “willingness to frankly share his opinions” was widely known. Though both sides are jockeying for legal advantage now, most such disagreements end in a settlement. Last fall the Trumps announced that BLT Prime, owned by New York’s ESquared Hospitality, would take over the restaurant space. Chef Oliver Beckert would oversee room service, catering and banquet services. Though he has avoided commenting on the ongoing legal wrangling, Andrés did take to Twitter days before the Republican primary in Maryland, tweeting a link to an   editorial and adding a message: “PEOPLE OF Maryland! remember! When You vote remember who only cares about himself?” Trump won the state’s primary with 54 percent of the vote.
