New York Times,Q1ZMitch Smith,"Q1ZMinnesota Officer Was ‘Reacting to the Presence of a Gun,’ Lawyer Says - The New York Times","Q1ZST. ANTHONY, Minn.  —   A lawyer for the suburban police officer who fatally shot a black man during a traffic stop said on Saturday that the race of the driver, Philando Castile, played no role in how his client responded, and that the officer “was reacting to the presence of a gun” when he opened fire. The comments from the lawyer, Thomas Kelly, provided the fullest accounting yet of Officer Jeronimo Yanez’s version of the shooting Wednesday night, even as many details remain unclear. Officer Yanez, of the St. Anthony police, is on leave while state authorities investigate the shooting, which has prompted protests and raised questions about what role race might have played in the stop. “The shooting had nothing to do with race and everything to do with the presence of that gun,” Mr. Kelly said in an interview, noting that Officer Yanez is Latino. Mr. Castile “was not following the directions of the police officer,” Mr. Kelly said, but he declined to provide further detail. Much of what is known about the shooting comes from a Facebook Live video of the aftermath streamed by Mr. Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds. In that video, in which Mr. Castile is seen bleeding profusely in the driver’s seat, Ms. Reynolds tells the officer that her boyfriend had been reaching for his identification when he was shot. She also suggested that he had a permit to legally carry a gun. “Please, officer, don’t tell me that you just did this to him,” Ms. Reynolds said in the video, which quickly gained international attention. “You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir. ” In the video, Ms. Reynolds said her boyfriend was stopped for a broken taillight. Mr. Kelly said there was “more than the reason for the equipment violation” to pull Mr. Castile over, but would not specify what those other reasons might have been. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is investigating the case, has released few details. The bureau has confirmed that the episode started as a traffic stop by Officer Yanez and a colleague near the state fairgrounds in Falcon Heights, a suburb patrolled by the St. Anthony Police Department. Mr. Castile died at a hospital shortly after the shooting. The bureau said a weapon was recovered at the scene. Gov. Mark Dayton, who has met with protesters and black leaders, has expressed sympathy for the Castile family and concerns about the role of race in the shooting, infuriating some in law enforcement. “Would this have happened if those passengers  —   the driver and the passengers  —   were white?” Mr. Dayton asked on Thursday. “I don’t think it would’ve. ” Protesters have gathered outside the governor’s residence in St. Paul since shortly after the shooting, and many have framed it as yet another episode of a black man being unjustly gunned down by a police officer. On Friday night, a sizable, racially diverse crowd gathered outside the governor’s mansion, where they had decorated the street with chalk messages like “This needs to end!” and “Justice 4 MN. ” The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has provided no timeline for when its investigation would be finished, though many expect it to take weeks or months. At that point, the case will go to the Ramsey County prosecutor, who can either decide on charges himself or present the evidence to a grand jury. Mr. Kelly said Officer Yanez had cooperated with investigators, providing informal information immediately after the shooting and giving a full statement within about 15 hours. “He’s very distressed about this incident, and he feels badly for the family of Philando Castile,” Mr. Kelly said. “It’s a tragic incident. ”",Q1Z2017-01-18Z1Q
New York Times,Q1ZGia Kourlas,Q1ZThis City Ballet Dancer Has a New Role: Being Bad - The New York Times,"Q1ZFairies can be so fickle. One night, all you want to do is break a spell. The next, with ice in your veins and a malicious flourish, you put a curse into action. On Thursday, Sara Mearns, the glamorous New York City Ballet principal, made an unlikely debut: the evil Fairy Carabosse in “The Sleeping Beauty. ” Her usual role, which she performed Wednesday, is the Lilac Fairy, Princess Aurora’s shimmering protector who counteracts Carabosse’s curse of death. Ms. Mearns, 31, is no polite ballerina, but an    dancer who reacts on the spot through her deep connection with music. Speaking twice in her dressing room on Thursday  —   once during intermission and later after her brief, ferocious appearance in the second act  —   Ms. Mearns reflected on the two roles. “Carabosse is like spitfire  —   short and sweet,” she said. “With the Lilac Fairy, I feel very empowered. You’re sort of in charge of the whole extravaganza. You’re always there. ” After a parting hug so she could take her bow  —   “Don’t get caught in the wing,” she said, referring not to the stage but to the appendage on her glittering black dress  —   she headed back out. For the record, the crowd roared. Ms. Mearns grinned with delight. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Who did you model Carabosse on?  I wanted her to be the Maleficent Disney [animated] version where she just stands there. She’s actually somewhat nice and doesn’t scream in the beginning. Peter [Martins, the ballet master in chief] told me: “Carabosse is just as beautiful as the Lilac Fairy. You should be above it all. But what’s different is that your soul is evil. ” Your rage seemed to bubble up inside of you. Is that what it felt like?  Yes. I actually didn’t think that was going to happen! When I’ve seen people do that, I’ve been like, there’s no way that I could get myself to do that. I would feel so stupid. And then when I got onstage, there was no one standing in front of me. I was just like, oh my God, this feels right. What did you not want Carabosse to be? I didn’t want to come out screaming like a crazy person. I feel like I have a really different approach. The music makes you want to go there because it’s so powerful  —   it makes you want to scream. The costume does it. You just standing there already does it. You just have to rein it in. It was hard, but once I really committed to the way I was going to do it, I felt comfortable. Was the experience what you thought it would be like?  Yes and no. I was waiting for this thrill of being evil onstage. I was more nervous than I thought I would be. I don’t think I’ve actually done a character role that doesn’t require dancing. There was such a different nervousness, such a different placement of your feet and your stance. Lilac Fairy is so much a part of me that I can grab it at a moment’s notice, but Carabosse is so much deeper and harder to find that it took everything out of me. I actually get more tired doing this because my whole body is so tense. You can’t hide behind your dancing, which is your comfort zone. Were you dancing with your hands?  Yes. The first time I had used the nails was in the stage rehearsal, and I saw how much you can do because your fingers are much longer than they normally are. I came up with this thing that I was doing on my chest. [She drummed her fingers slowly.] That part made me laugh.  I came up with it in the shower this morning. I felt like my hands were dancing instead of my feet. Your nails are scary. What are they? They’re plastic fingers, and we have to tape them on. In the dress rehearsal, I lost two nails when I pulled off [the master of ceremonies] Catalabutte’s wig because I didn’t tape them right. I can’t really feel my fingertips right now because they’re so tight, but it’s good. They won’t fall off. Does Carabosse produce a different kind of adrenaline than the Lilac Fairy?  Yes. Dancing adrenaline is excitement  —   it’s like, I can’t wait to do those steps, I can’t wait to have that feeling. This is deeper. It’s a   thing happening. You transform your soul to a dark place. You’re not really happy when you come offstage. I couldn’t tell if you were annoyed because you had to do an interview, or if you were still in character.  [Laughs.] No. I’m still so mad! When you come off, you’re not like, I did such a great job. You’re simmering. With Carabosse, you can really go for it. You can scare people, throw people, just do whatever. I want to shock them.",Q1Z2017-02-13Z1Q
New York Times,Q1ZJack Ewing,Q1ZSome Early Signs of ‘Brexit’ Upheaval - The New York Times,"Q1ZFRANKFURT  —   Only hours after Britain decided to leave the European Union, Emmanuel Lumineau cast his own “remain” vote  —   with his feet. Mr. Lumineau said he would move to Paris from London and take about 10 employees at his financial   with him. The looming question on Friday was how many other executives might reach the same conclusion, undermining Britain’s status as the No. 1 destination in Europe for foreign investment. Mr. Lumineau’s reasoning was simple. His customers operate under European rules and so must he. “We need to be inside,” said Mr. Lumineau, the French chief executive of BrickVest, a company that allows customers to invest small sums in real estate online. The   business consequences of Brexit will take years to fully emerge, largely because no one knows what kind of new trade barriers and regulations will emerge from negotiations with the European Union. But already there were worrisome signs that the “remain” camp’s warnings of economic tumult could come true. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, warned his staff in a memo on Friday that in months to come “we may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles. ” Mr. Dimon had said before the vote that up to a quarter of JPMorgan’s 16, 000 employees in Britain might need to relocate. Shares of British property companies plunged Friday on fears that the Brexit vote will cause a recession and deflate London’s real estate boom. Jürgen Maier, the top executive in Britain of Siemens, the German electronics and engineering giant, said it might need to rethink its investment plans. He predicted others would do the same, at least until they can judge the impact of Brexit. “All companies will be holding fire to see what happens,” said Mr. Maier, Siemens’s chief executive for Britain. For decades, big multinational companies have used Britain as their     beachhead to Europe. As a member of the European Union, Britain offered frictionless access to the mainland, while the legacy of Margaret Thatcher meant there was far less regulation than in France or Germany. Now that the English Channel suddenly seems a lot wider, businesses are waiting nervously to see what kind of new Europe will take shape. Negotiations on a   trade relationship are likely to be messy and take years. And in the meantime, Europe could be in for serious political instability as   parties in France, Finland and other countries try to ride Britain’s coattails out of the union. It is not all bad for business. The plunging pound will help the tourism industry by making Britain cheaper to visit. BMW Mini automobiles and other products manufactured in Britain will be less expensive for people paying in euros and other foreign currencies. That could be good for exports. Britain could also be free to follow its free market instincts without interference from Brussels. If the “leave” forces are correct, that would make the country a magnet for companies seeking to escape the regulatory corset of mainland Europe. But any advantages are likely to be outweighed by the enormous uncertainties ahead. With no road map, executive   could be paralyzed and investment could come to a standstill. Britain’s financial services industry, which employs 1. 2 million people, is especially vulnerable. New stock listings in London are likely to all but cease while companies take stock of the damage. Foreign banks may face the costs of moving thousands of employees out of London to the Continent so they can satisfy regulations governing trading and investment advice on behalf of European clients. London had provided a convenient hub to serve Europe. James P. Gorman, the Morgan Stanley chief executive, and Colm Kelleher, the president, said Friday that they had no plans to relocate staff from London. But in a memo to employees  —   many of whom worked through the night to handle a huge trading volume  —   they said they might “consider adjustments to our operating model. ” Even Deutsche Bank, the symbol of German banking nominally based in Frankfurt, uses London as a base for investment banking and trading. It has often made most of its profit there. “I’m afraid that this is not such a good day for Europe,” said John Cryan, the Deutsche Bank chief, who happens to be British. “At this stage, we cannot fully foresee the consequences, but there’s no doubt that they will be negative on all sides. ” Perhaps no company embodies the European project more than Airbus, a politically driven consortium that allowed Europe to remain a player in the aircraft industry after smaller national manufacturers could no longer compete. Airbus produces wings in Broughton and employs 15, 000 people in Britain plus tens of thousands more at suppliers. Outside the union, Britain may no longer have as strong a claim on those jobs. “This is a   result for both Britain and Europe,” said Thomas Enders, the Airbus chief executive. “We will review our U. K. investment strategy, like everybody else will. ” Other sectors as different as petrochemicals and Scottish whisky could be damaged by increases in customs duties, diverging legal requirements and slumping growth. Energy companies like BP or Royal Dutch Shell are worried about having to deal with an unwieldy snarl of differing regulations once the European Union umbrella is gone. “Uncertainty is never helpful for a business such as ours,” BP said in a statement Friday. United States technology companies like Google and Facebook have sizable operations in Britain, though their headquarters are technically in   countries like Ireland and the Netherlands. Google employs roughly 1, 000 engineers across Britain, working on global products like its search engine and Android mobile operating system. Technology companies could be under pressure to move sales and marketing jobs from Britain, so these employees can still have access to Europe’s common marketplace. The ties are especially close between Britain and Germany, where the dismay was particularly pronounced. Britain imports more products from Germany than anywhere else. Britain is Germany’s   customer for exports, after the United States and France. German brands like BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen account for half the cars sold in Britain, according to the German Association of the Automobile Industry. Sales could suffer if Britain raises tariffs on imported vehicles. Shares of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen plunged Friday. German companies have helped keep alive manufacturing in Britain. Mini and   are considered iconic British car brands, but both are owned by BMW. Bentley belongs to Volkswagen. Probably the most important company in the renaissance of British car manufacturing has been Nissan, which has pumped close to 4 billion pounds since the   into a   factory in Sunderland in northeast England. Last year the company produced about 475, 000 vehicles, about a third of Britain’s total, exporting about 55 percent of them to the European Union. Yet despite the European Union’s importance to local jobs, voters in Sunderland voted overwhelmingly to leave. The Brexit camp won 61 percent of the vote compared with 39 percent for remain. Stuart Boyd, a Nissan spokesman, said on Friday that the company was not ready to comment on how it might respond. Perhaps workers believed that Nissan sales would increase because of a weaker pound. But any stimulus to British exports from a devalued currency is likely to be offset by higher prices for imported goods. Britain has a trade deficit, so a weaker pound is on balance negative. Another huge foreign manufacturer is Siemens, based in Munich, which has 13 factories and 14, 000 workers in Britain making products like electric motors, gas turbines and trains. Siemens is not about to pull up stakes. But Mr. Maier, the Siemens chief for Britain, said the Brexit vote could force the company to recalculate some investment decisions. For example, European Union grants help finance Siemens research and development projects in Britain in areas like   cars. That financial support will disappear once Britain is out. “The question is more about future investment, future research and development,” Mr. Maier said. “That’s hanging in the balance. ” He embodies the strong ties between Britain and the mainland. Born in Germany, Mr. Maier has lived in Britain since he was 10, studied there, and speaks with a British accent. He said that there was a palpable sense of anxiety Friday morning when he visited a company office in Manchester that is used by engineers and customer service representatives. “It’s usually a really buzzing office,” Mr. Maier said. “This morning it was definitely quiet. Customers weren’t calling. That’s not a good sign. The country is just taking all of this in. ”",Q1Z2016-12-03Z1Q
New York Times,Q1ZRichard Pérez-Peña and Rachel Abrams,Q1ZTrump Assails Nordstrom for ‘Unfairly’ Dropping His Daughter Ivanka’s Line - The New York Times,"Q1ZWASHINGTON  —   President Trump lashed out on Wednesday at the Nordstrom department store chain for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s accessories and clothing line, once again raising ethical questions about the relationship between his presidency and his family’s sprawling business interests. Mr. Trump has already broken with tradition by singling out companies for criticism, like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, automakers and news organizations, sometimes causing gyrations in their stock prices and prompting debates about whether corporations would tailor their conduct to suit a bellicose president. But in those cases, his ire targeted government contracts, departing American jobs or news coverage  —   not his own family’s personal fortunes. Six days after Nordstrom announced that, based on sales, it would no longer carry Ms. Trump’s products  —   a decision that prompted some Trump supporters to call for a boycott of the stores  —   the president took to Twitter to complain that “Ivanka has been treated so unfairly” by the company. He first posted the message from his personal account, and then   it from his official White House account. Mr. Trump’s complaint also raised questions about how he might handle the moves of numerous other companies as their relationships with Trump brands change. The large national discount retailers T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department store, for example, have recently taken steps to give less prominence to Ms. Trump’s products. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, said the president’s tweet was not about business but about “an attack on his daughter. ” “For people to take out their concern about his actions, or his executive orders, on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family,” Mr. Spicer said. It was not clear if Mr. Spicer was referring to critics of Mr. Trump who have called for a boycott of businesses bearing the family name, or to some political motive by Nordstrom. After the president temporarily barred people from seven   countries from entering the United States, Nordstrom sent its employees a statement saying that it valued immigrants and offered support to those affected by the executive order. On Wednesday, responding to Mr. Spicer’s comments, Nordstrom maintained that it had pulled Ms. Trump’s products based on their declining sales performance. The company said it informed Ms. Trump of its decision in early January. “Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now,” the Nordstrom statement said. “We’ve had a great relationship with the Ivanka Trump team. ” As Mr. Trump has noted several times, the president is exempt from conflict of interest provisions in federal law that prohibit other government officials from using their positions to benefit themselves or their family members financially. So even if his post was meant to intimidate Nordstrom or other retailers that still work with Ivanka Trump, it probably does not violate conflict of interest rules, said ethics experts, who nonetheless called it inappropriate. “It is a total misuse of presidential power,” said Lawrence M. Noble, the general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center and formerly the top lawyer at the Federal Election Commission. “He is really bringing to bear the whole weight of the office of president on a business decision. Take another company that is considering whether or not to drop her line  —   they obviously are going to ask themselves if they want to be attacked by the president. ” Mr. Trump’s blast at Nordstrom came two days after his wife, Melania, filed a libel lawsuit that described her “multiyear term” as “one of the most photographed women in the world”  —   an apparent reference to her status as a candidate’s wife and now first lady  —   as a lucrative business opportunity. And Mr. Spicer, the White House spokesman, has urged people to visit the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which opened late last year. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a group that promotes ethics in government, said Mr. Trump’s swipe at Nordstrom was not a major issue in itself. But Mr. Weissman said it demonstrates that as president, Mr. Trump continues to have multiple conflicts of interest with his own and his family’s business interests. Mr. Trump refuses to sell his assets or put them into a blind trust, but he has said that he has ceded operation of his businesses to his adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric. “He has committed to severing himself from the family business operations,” Mr. Weissman said. “That is obviously not the case. ” Ivanka Trump has no formal role in the administration, but her father has included her in meetings with foreign officials and business leaders, and her husband, Jared Kushner, is an adviser to the president. After years as a business executive, Ms. Trump has suddenly found herself without a clear path to walk as she adjusts to life in Washington. She has expressed frustration to a number of associates with Nordstrom’s decision, describing it as a political move and maintaining that the sales of her brand had not sagged. While she is no longer involved in the management of her business, she is said to be acutely aware of the controversies surrounding her product line. The Trump presidency is forcing retailers to rethink their relationships with Trump product lines, weighing how well they sell and what actions will anger or placate the largest number of customers. After Nordstrom said it was dropping Ivanka Trump’s merchandise, Trump supporters on social media began calling for a boycott of the stores. Last week, T. J. Maxx and Marshalls stores sent a note to employees  —   a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times  —   telling them to throw away signs for Ivanka Trump products. “Effective immediately, please remove all Ivanka Trump merchandise from features and mix into” the racks where most products hang, the note read. “All Ivanka Trump signs should be discarded. ” The instruction was to eliminate special displays for the merchandise, “not to remove it from the sales floor,” said Doreen Thompson, a spokeswoman for the TJX Companies, the retailers’ parent corporation. “We offer a rapidly changing selection of merchandise for our customers, and brands are featured based on a number of factors,” she said. Ms. Thompson did not respond directly to questions about whether instructing stores to discard signs was unusual. But an employee at one of the company’s stores, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said she had not received such a request during her several years working there. Neiman Marcus recently stopped selling Ms. Trump’s jewelry and accessories through its website, but her clothes are still sold at Macy’s, the nation’s largest department store chain, as well as its sister company Bloomingdale’s, where her shoes and handbags are available online. In August, Bloomingdale’s committed to selling her clothes in seven of its stores, according to a spokeswoman, Anne Keating. “I think they all have probably been looking closely at Ivanka’s sales numbers and weighing whether they’re worth all the problems she’s brought them,” said Shannon Coulter, who helped found #GrabYourWallet, an online campaign to boycott Trump products.",Q1Z2017-02-09Z1Q

Breitbart,Q1ZMatthew Boyle,"Q1ZDonald Trump Gambles Big, Skipping CPAC To Campaign In Kansas - Breitbart","Q1ZNATIONAL HARBOR, Maryland  —   Donald Trump’s decision to skip the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) here —  a major gamble, and potentially a huge mistake —  comes right as he’s aiming to unite conservatives   behind his campaign. [This move may jeopardize potential unity soon in the movement, even as signs of people getting behind him were beginning to show here.  “He spoke before I was chairman and the crowd always loves him,” American Conservative Union (ACU) chairman Matt Schlapp said in an interview with Breitbart News before Trump canceled. “He didn’t do great in the straw poll last year. My guess is he’ll do really well in the straw poll this year. ” Schlapp was even at that point defending Trump from former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee who did appear at CPAC. “I think it’s a pivotal moment,” Schlapp told Breitbart News when asked about the importance of CPAC as it relates to the presidential campaign. I don’t know whether there’s weeks or months left in this race, before we really have a consensus nominee. But it’s time for everybody to do everything they can to get their candidate. Waiting seems unwise. I saw what Gov. Romney did today and I thought if you felt that much passion about this, you know Donald Trump’s the same guy as he was the day he got into this race. Nobody took him seriously. I think they thought he would just fall away but I think they’ve seen the opposite. I think the message they’ve taken from voters is now it’s a big threat they now have to stop. Part of me says great, go for it —  this is America, do what you believe and leave it all on the field. Part of my brain says why? What’s the rationale for this. Trump announced —  as did CPAC, which is hosted by the ACU just outside Washington, D. C. annually —  on Friday morning that he’s pulling out of the event. The announcement came after a contentious debate in Detroit on Thursday evening. The exchange on   visas had him rattled, and saying on stage that he’s “changed” his viewpoint on the matter. After the debate, Trump blasted out a press release stating that he hadn’t changed his viewpoint. CPAC Tweeted on Friday that they are “very disappointed” Trump “has decided at the last minute to drop out of” the event. “His choice sends a clear message to conservatives,” the conference Tweeted. Very disappointed @realDonaldTrump has decided at the last minute to drop out of #CPAC  —   his choice sends a clear message to conservatives.  —   CPAC (@CPAC) March 4, 2016,  Trump’s campaign also issued a statement, saying he’s instead focusing on shoring up votes ahead of the Kansas caucuses on Saturday by holding a rally in Wichita. The Donald J. Trump for President Campaign has just announced it will be in Witchita, Kanasas for a major rally on Saturday prior to Caucus,” the Trump campaign said. “He will also be speaking at the Kansas Caucus and then departing for Orlando, Florida and a crowd of approximately 20, 000 people or more. Because of this, he will not be able to speak at CPAC as he has done for many consecutive years. Mr. Trump would like to thank Matt Schlapp and all of the executives at CPAC and looks forward to returning to next year, hopefully as President of the United States. Newt Gingrich, a 2012 GOP presidential candidate and the former U. S. House Speaker, said on Twitter that Trump was “right. ” “Trump was right to skip CPAC,” Gingrich said. “The votes are in Kansas not Washington. Why give the   activists a target. ” Trump was right to skip CPAC. The votes are in Kansas not Washington. Why give the   activists a target,  —   Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) March 4, 2016,  While Gingrich might be right about that point about where the votes are, Trump   at the largest annual conservative movement event —  one Ronald Reagan, the former president, attended 13 times —  may hurt his ability to unite that movement behind his campaign, something he made clear he knows he has to do to win the general election during his   Tuesday press conference. Since Trump is and always has been a brute force populist nationalist —  and not a movement conservative —  the crowd that gathers here at CPAC from the traditional conservative movement has naturally been skeptical of his political rise. Sens. Ted Cruz ( ) and Marco Rubio ( ) Trump’s chief competitors, are both appearing here as is Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Each of them has sought to spread and push that skepticism of Trump’s nationalism among movement conservatives in 2016, probably one of the biggest obstacles holding Trump back from total and complete domination in elections. Trump supporter Carl Higbie, who appears on television and radio on Trump’s behalf regularly, told Breitbart News the night before Trump announced he’s skipping CPAC that he thought Trump’s speech here should emulate the gracious and humble press conference he gave after his big night on Super Tuesday. “I think if we saw another speech much like the one he just gave after Super Tuesday —  if we see that level of presidential unity and that type of presidential behavior from Mr. Trump, I think he’s going to start winning over some of the establishment guys,” Higbie said. “And I think it’s already starting a little bit. ” It certainly is. Trump has won endorsements from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) Rep. Duncan Hunter ( ) Rep. Chris Collins ( ) Maine Gov. Paul LePage, and former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. What’s more, several other major GOP players have started sounding a lot like they’re open to him. “Oh absolutely,” Rep. Marsha Blackburn ( ) a powerful and connected conservative congresswoman who is heading the select committee investigating Planned Parenthood, told Breitbart News here when asked if Americans’ anger at Washington is justified. “I talked about that in my speech. I call this righteous anger. I think we can look at Jesus throwing over the tables in the templet and say this is what people are feeling: Righteous anger. They are sick of special interests taking control of Washington, D. C. They love their country too much so they’re fighting back. ” Trump just won Blackburn’s Tennessee on Super Tuesday, and she told Breitbart News that the key takeaway from Trump’s victory and Cruz’s   finish is that “it’s an outsider year. ” “People are looking for somebody who’s not going to go along to get along,” Blackburn said. “They’re looking for someone who’s going to care for the Constitution more than they’re going to care for personalities. ” Blackburn added that “sure, absolutely” the Republican Party will get behind Trump if he wins the nomination. “I think so,” Blackburn said. “I think you’re going to have some people who they just don’t like him, and they’re not going to support him, but by and large people are going to support Donald Trump if he’s the nominee. ” Blackburn added that “absolutely” the same goes for Cruz, Kasich or Rubio. Rep. Jim Jordan ( ) the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus which led the way in removing John Boehner from the Speakership and has been a change agent in the House, told Breitbart News similarly that the electorate is justifiably upset at lackluster   in Washington. “It’s one of the reasons we created the Freedom Caucus,” Jordan told Breitbart News here. Because we feel like there are a countless number of Americans who feel like Washington has forgotten them. In the Freedom Caucus, our goal every day is to figure out how we can be effective fighting for those families who feel like they’re forgotten and to do what we told the voters we were going to do. So, yes, there’s a frustration out there and we feel that on the inside as well. So we formed this so we can better do what we told the voters we were going to do. So yeah, it’s real. You’re feeling it in this race. But I also think the approximately 40 members of the Freedom Caucus, their constituents know they are fighting to do what they said they would do. I think voters respect that with those members. Sen. Ron Johnson ( ) an outsider himself who worked in business before his election to the U. S. Senate in 2010, told Breitbart News that what he’s looking for in GOP presidential candidates is an “agenda, a vision, for America in terms of who we’re going to get our economy moving. ” “The kind of economic security that feeds into national security,” Johnson said. Then hopefully they demonstrate to Republican primary voters how they would beat Hillary Clinton. It’s vital. This election is for all the marbles. The tragic passing of Justice Scalia, the vacancy on the court, this is for two branches of government —  this is for the presidency and this for the Supreme Court —  and we’ve got to maintain our majorities in both the House and the Senate. This is for all the marbles. Johnson, who chairs the Homeland Security committee in the U. S. Senate, told Breitbart News that the intense focus on national security and immigration matters in this presidential election —  which is thanks in large part to Trump —  is promising to him. “Absolutely, that’s the top priority of our committee,” Johnson, who’s up for   this cycle, said. “We’ve held 14 hearings on border security alone. We’ve published a   report on our findings and they’re not real cheery findings. Our border is completely insecure and it’s because on a bipartisan basis we have not made a commitment to secure the border. It’s going to be a top priority and a top issue in this campaign. ” Rep. Roger Williams ( ) who’s backing Cruz for president, told Breitbart News he’s looking for “a message of less government” from the presidential candidates here. “My platform is what I want them to talk about,” Williams said. “Lower taxes, less government, cut spending, defend your borders, stand with Israel. I want them to talk about the Constitution as it’s written. I want them to talk about the Bible, and how it’s helping them get through this. So I think that’s what they need to say and I hope that’s what they’re going to talk about. Of course, I’ve endorsed Sen. Cruz and that’s where he is on the issues. ” Williams said of Cruz that “he’s going to continue to talk about what he talks about,” which is how Cruz is a “true conservative and he’s going to do what the Constitution tells him to do. ” Williams added that while he thinks Cruz is the only candidate left who can beat Trump in the GOP primary, if Trump does end up winning everyone needs to get behind his campaign moving into the general election. “I think so,” Williams said when asked if Cruz’s victories in Texas, Oklahoma, and Alaska prove he’s the best suited to take on Trump, before adding:  But look, we have to support the person who wins. We can’t have another four years or eight years of Hillary Clinton. Are you kidding me? It would tear this country apart. I’m a Sen. Cruz man, but what I’m saying is he’s the only one —  and Donald Trump —  that can win states. I think Marco Rubio needs to probably take —  we got the 15th coming up. If he can’t win Florida, he needs to get out. If Kasich can’t win Ohio, he needs to get out and let the people decide on who’s the best to run our country. Rep. Ron DeSantis ( ) who’s currently running for the U. S. Senate seat Rubio will vacate at the end of this term thanks to Rubio’s presidential campaign, echoed Trump by saying the message the GOP candidates need to bring to CPAC is “energy, energy, energy. ” “We’ve had eight long years [of a Democrat president] and to add another four years to that, our country is going to be in such a hole so we have a chance to fight back and so we really have a chance to get our country back on the right track of limited government, the Constitution, individual initiative,” DeSantis said. “I’m hopeful. I think after eight years, I think the country is in the mood for something different. I think you’re seeing that out there with how many people are showing up in these Republican primaries. ” DeSantis, who is remaining neutral in the presidential race, said the discussion of “substantive ideas” like national security and immigration matters on the campaign trail is a good thing. The more you’re discussing substantive ideas, I mean one of the issues that’s been discussed in these debates is the ‘Gang of Eight’ bill,” DeSantis said of Rubio’s legislation. “I think that that’s good. I was very much opposed to that —  and a lot of conservatives were —  but those are things that I think need to be aired out. I think that there’s a lot of insults, there’s too many of those, but there has been some substantive discussions. DeSantis added that there is no doubt Donald Trump is currently leading big in Florida. I think if you look at the polls, Donald Trump I think has led in every poll in Florida for like the last three months,” DeSantis said. “I think he’s in the drivers’ seat and you have these other guys, Rubio and Cruz, who are going to have to show some voters that they need to break with them because I think as things are going right now, I think Trump has probably got a pretty solid lead throughout the state. I’m not a good prognosticator, but I will say in Florida people have already been voting early and if the narrative —  even if you start changing minds, there are already votes baked in the cake. It’s good to be leading three weeks out because you actually will bank votes three weeks out. Rep. John Fleming ( ) who’s running for U. S. Senate in Louisiana, told Breitbart News that “it’s just too early to be able to divine those things” when asked if the party will get behind Trump if he wins the nomination. “I’ll tell you that certainly I’ll consider getting behind whoever the nominee is, and I’m going to hold back until I know,” Fleming said. “But I do think we should come together as Republicans but also I think we need to listen to the American people. Obviously, they’re not up for the same old Republican establishment ideas and candidates. They want something new. ” Fleming said “I think it is” when asked if the process that’s playing out is healthy for the party and for conservatives. “I think it is very healthy —  that’s the whole point,” Fleming said. I think too much has been hidden from people in Washington. The establishment has been listening to the special interests and not to the people and they’re just now figuring that out —  the people across our country, our base. And they say “you know what, you guys never were listening to us, Republicans and Democrats, and it’s time to start listening. ” Fleming said that when Louisiana selects its candidate on Saturday, he doesn’t have any insights into what might happen other than that he expects an outsider to win.  I just think it’s going to be an outsider, whoever that is, because where everybody is coming from is the outside. But you know when it comes to the outside, I helped create the Freedom Caucus, and look at the change we brought. We tossed the Speaker of the House and we blocked the second in command from taking over. That’s what the American people want to hear from us. Whatever comes in 2016 in November, it’s going to have to do with people wanting change. It remains to be seen what the fallout from this is going to be. It’s unclear if this obvious but    movement in the conservative movement shift    towards Trump will continue after the CPAC snub. It’s also certainly possible that Trump   at CPAC doesn’t have any effect at all on it. “I think people are genuinely —  people are so pissed off —  and so frustrated, they just want someone to disrupt,” videographer James O’Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas —  which does undercover video investigations into bastions of big government —  told Breitbart News. I think people just want a disrupter. That’s why you’re seeing Trump and Cruz do so well. If you’re an establishment guy, you have to convince people you’ll lead disruption. It’s not even a ‘conservative’ thing. I don’t think these people necessarily make conservatism a priority. These people just want someone who’s going to shake things up. Some people say Trump is the opposite of liberty —  I don’t necessarily disagree. But he definitely is the opposite of Washington. So if you’re an establishment guy, you’ve got to find a way to channel the disruption. That’d be my advice —  if you don’t do that, you’re not going to win. “I really think that this is down to a two man race, Trump and Cruz, and I hope that these people let Marco Rubio and John Kasich know that they need to get out,” Dave Bossie, the head of Citizens United, added, noting that it’s unlikely to have a huge impact on Trump’s chances from here on out.",Q1Z2016-03-04Z1Q
Breitbart,Q1ZAdelle Nazarian,Q1ZBlack Lives Matter Scares BART Official into Carrying Gun - Breitbart,"Q1ZFear of violence from the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement spurred a member of BART’s board to apply, successfully, for a renewed carry and conceal license for a handgun so that he is able to protect himself. [John McPartland, 71, has served on BART’s board since 2008. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, in his most recent application for the renewal of his license on April 20, 2015, he expressed that his role as a decision maker on “controversial issues” puts him at risk to be targeted by individuals with oppositional views.  “As an elected official, I am often the decision maker and focal point on controversial issues,” McPartland reportedly wrote. “Some of those issues are volatile, draw a great deal of media and result in violence by irrational members of the public. ” McPartland has apparently had the license since at least 2010. In his application, he referenced to violent protests by activists in California following the 2009 shooting of Oscar Grant by BART, police and an incident that same year in which a man threw red paint on   Manager Dorothy Dugger. Several members of the Black Lives Matter movement have protested McPartland’s ability to conceal a weapon for protection. One, Cat Brooks, was among several people arrested on Black Friday back in November when members of the BLM movement chained themselves to an Oakland BART train. Brooks told the Chronicle that when she found out BLM was listed as one of the reasons why McParland needed a conceal and carry license, it was “offering up a shining example of why we need the Black Lives Matter movement. The idea that black bodies assembled, asserting our rights   …     would mean that he should need to use deadly force against someone is absurd. ” The movement, which has popularized the slogan “no justice, no peace,” has often presented itself in a violent manner. Student protesters with the “Oxy United for Black Liberation” from Los   Occidental College demanded in November that unarmed campus officers stop wearing bulletproof vests  —   arguably their only method of defense against any potential harm. On Monday, the Kingsburg High School District Board became the second district in California to allow certain staff members with a license to carry a concealed weapon, to bring a gun on campus. According to local ABC News affiliate in Fresno ABC 30, the move was in large part a response to the devastating attack carried out by radical Islamic terrorists Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik this past December in San Bernardino.

CNN,Q1ZThom Patterson,Q1ZThe rock guitarist ’better’ than Hendrix,"Q1Z (CNN) One night backstage at Los Angeles’ legendary Whisky a Go Go in the late 1960s, a young Midwestern saxophone player named Walt Parazaider felt a tap on his shoulder after performing with his newly formed band, Chicago Transit Authority. ”It was Jimi Hendrix,” Parazaider remembered, smiling.   Hendrix, already well known at the time as a guitar wizard, had just watched the band’s set.  ”Walt, the horns are like one set of lungs,” Parazaider said Hendrix told him. ”And your guitar player is better than me.” That guitarist, Terry Kath, went on to be hailed by many as one of rock’s greatest    a ”forgotten guitar god” who was ”criminally underrated.” Kath ”could play a rhythm guitar part, a lead guitar part and sing a lead vocal simultaneously. I’ve never heard anybody that could do that,” said the band’s trumpet player, Lee Loughnane. After that first meeting at the Whisky, Hendrix invited Kath and the rest of the band to join his tour. Band members recalled that huge break and the story of Terry Kath in CNN Films’ ”Now More than Ever: The History of Chicago.” Touring with Hendrix propelled Chicago Transit Authority    whose name was later shortened to simply Chicago    toward a career that would include 21 Top 10 hits such as ”Hard to Say I’m Sorry,” ”Saturday in the Park,” ”25 or 6 to 4” and ”If You Leave Me Now.” But the band has also had to overcome massive hurdles    including a tragic one involving Kath.  The rise of rock royalty, Growing up in the 1970s, you could rarely go anywhere without hearing Chicago’s music    their domination of Top 40 radio ensured they would be playing in the car, at the beach or at the local shopping mall.  The popularity of the song ”25 or 6 to 4”    on which Kath has a raging guitar solo    was so widespread that whenever there was a piano in the room, someone always seemed to bang out its distinctive   pattern.  Their stellar horn section made it inevitable that a school band would play their songs during ball games. And the   piano motif in Chicago’s love song ”Colour My World”    sung by Kath    became the theme of countless high school proms.  But at first, this band wasn’t exactly mainstream. Chicago came out of the Windy City’s ’60s   and most of the band members met as music students with hopes of creating      songs that reflected the tumultuous times. They also wanted to dabble in experimental music.  On the band’s 1969   debut album, Kath raised eyebrows with his nearly   instrumental guitar extravaganza called ”Free Form Guitar.”  Electric guitar lovers still talk about that   recording all these years later.  In 2014, Guitar Player magazine called ”Free Form Guitar” ”astounding.” Players said it proved that Kath’s manipulation of the strings, fretboard and effects were ahead of his time. On the track, there are moments when he plays around with ”  tapping,” a style that would be made popular a decade later by a young upstart guitarist from the Netherlands. You may have heard about that Dutch boy rocker. His name: Eddie Van Halen. Kath’s singing and guitar prowess supported the band’s mainstream success, including his   soulful lead vocal on ”Make Me Smile.” Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell reportedly has described Kath as a vocal inspiration. Kath was ”the fastest guitar player I’ve ever seen,” Electric Light Orchestra’s Jeff Lynne recently wrote on Facebook. Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh, an icon in his own right, recently called Kath ”one of the most underrated guitar legends of the ’70s.” A party and a handgun change everything, By 1978, Kath and the band were riding high on their success, enjoying the life in LA. Kath and his wife, Camilia, had a    daughter, and Kath had his sights set on recording a solo album.  But one night, at a friend’s party in LA’s Woodland Hills, Kath    who collected firearms    started cleaning a handgun he’d brought with him.  The host of the party reminded Kath it was late and he probably shouldn’t be handling guns, said Chicago trombonist Jimmy Pankow.  ”(Kath) said, ’Hey, I know what I’m doing.’ He pulled out the clip of the gun to show that there was nothing in the clip and that it wasn’t loaded,” Pankow said. But, the musician continued, apparently there was still a round in the chamber. As a joke, Kath pointed the gun at his temple and pulled the trigger, Pankow recalled.  Kath died instantly. He was only 31.  Kath’s death changed the band forever, forcing them to consider breaking up. They eventually decided against it, hired a new guitarist and morphed into other styles    including power ballads in the 1980s that included songs such as ”Hard to Say I’m Sorry,” ”You’re the Inspiration” and ”Hard Habit to Break,” all sung by bassist Peter Cetera, who left the band in 1985. Chicago still tours, and Parazaider told SaultStar. com that he’d like to think Kath would still be with them if he were alive. ”But he was very independent, and I wonder what he would have thought about the 1980s,” he said. ”I’d have to say it’s  . It could have gone either way.”  ’He wasn’t too into fame’ Chicago shows no sign of stopping, and still acknowledges that its sound was formed by ”the ferocious force and drive” of Kath’s playing, as keyboardist and lead singer Robert Lamm told vegasseven. com.  At the beginning of every show, the band tips its hat to Kath by playing ”Introduction,” a song written and originally sung by the late musician for the band’s first album. Since 1995, Kath’s guitar part is played by the band’s current lead guitarist, Keith Howland, who shreds it. Fans, too, have kept Kath’s memory alive. Last May, when Chicago was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, some audience members held up signs hailing the great Terry Kath all these years later. ”He wasn’t too into fame, but I think he would be beyond honored and extremely excited to be recognized along with his very talented bandmates,” daughter Michelle Kath Sinclair said during the induction ceremony.  So was the man Hendrix described as better than him one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time?

CNN,Q1ZKatie Hunt,Q1ZChina: South China Sea island building ’almost complete’,"Q1ZHong Kong (CNN) China’s foreign ministry says it will soon complete controversial land reclamation on some islands and reefs in disputed waters in the South China Sea.  However, the ministry also said in a statement released Tuesday that it planned to build facilities on the artificial islands it has created and these would perform several tasks    including military defense. ”According to the planned operation, China is about to complete the land reclamation operation at some of the Nansha islands where China has been stationed,” the statement said. It did not give a time frame.  China has placed artillery pieces on one of its manufactured islands, the U. S. says, and China has announced plans for two lighthouses. Alarm   Last year, China stepped up land reclamation on several reefs in contested waters close to the Spratly Islands (called Nansha by China) alarming its Asian neighbors.  The United States says that China has reclaimed some 2, 000 acres    1, 500 football fields     in the past 18 months and has called for an ”immediate and lasting” halt to the island building.  In May, a U. S. surveillance plane carrying a CNN crew flew over some of China’s artificial islands, triggered eight warnings from the Chinese navy to back off.  The South China Sea is the subject of numerous rival    often messy    territorial claims, with China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam disputing sovereignty of several island chains and nearby waters. The areas in dispute include fertile fishing grounds and potentially rich reserves of undersea natural resources. China reiterated that its construction did not target any other countries or affect freedom of navigation by sea or air.  BEHIND THE SCENES: China’s island buildup",Q1Z2015-06-17Z1Q
CNN,Q1ZJuliet Perry,Q1ZPreparing for the worst: How to escape Kim Jong Un,"Q1ZSeoul (CNN) It’s a bitterly cold, bleak day on a military base in South Korea. People are milling around calmly, clutching hot coffees, making small talk. Kids are chasing each other around an air hangar.  It’s hard to believe they are practicing a   emergency evacuation that simulates what would happen if North Korea invaded.  ”In real life, everyone would be wearing masks, rushing through places,” says mom of two Nicholle Martinez. ”There would be chaos everywhere. It would be scarier.”  Nicholle met Nick Martinez when they were both stationed with the US military in Seoul. They’ve now been married for nine years and have two beautiful, energetic and charismatic children. Briannah, 6, is in first grade, and Alannah, 8, is in third.  In many respects they’re very typical. They go to church on Sundays and have lunch together afterward. They like to play sports    mom and dad want the girls to grow into healthy, strong young ladies.  Briannah wants to be a teacher, Alannah wants to be president. But, because the whole family is now living on post in Seoul, the Martinez family lives with the   danger of a very noisy and unpredictable neighbor    Kim Jong Un. In the face of escalating tension, the Martinez women are practicing their path to safety. In a   exercise, they traveled by bus, helicopter and military plane from South Korea all the way to the Pacific island of Okinawa, Japan.  In a CNN exclusive, we went along with them for the ride. All those taking part in the drill are volunteers    relations of US soldiers stationed in Seoul. Unlike in a real scenario, they’ve had the opportunity to plan a little for this event.  There are a number of reasons why an order like this could be enacted, says Justin Sturn, a   evacuation planner. He uses the 2011 earthquake in Japan or the recent evacuation of   from Turkey as examples.  However, for all the claims this is a routine practice run, Kim’s threats loom over the exercise. In September, North Korea said it had hit the button on its fifth and potentially most powerful nuclear test. International condemnation and aggressive sanctions have done little to impede the regime’s nuclear ambitions.  In a New Year’s address, Kim said that his country is close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile.  ”He’s said publicly that we’re the enemy,” says Sturn.  ”With all the rhetoric that comes out of North Korea, of course we have to prepare for the worst case scenario.” Military families stationed in South Korea are encouraged to have a bag ready to go at all times. ”I have a duffel bag that is always packed with sleeping bags and canned food,” says Nicholle. According to Sturn, the decision to get soldiers’ families out of the country would come right from the top.  A   evacuation order (NEO) is a political decision, not a military one. ”We would conduct the mission, but the execution is still a Department of State decision,” says Sturn. The Army is trying to make the environment as realistic as possible.  Family members are permitted to bring along 60 pounds of personal stuff each. Military representatives urge the group to only bring the bare essentials. I ask the Martinez family what went into their bags first. ”My cellphone!” says Nicholle in a heartbeat.  ”My blanket,” says   old Alannah. She wraps her comfort around herself like a cape. Briannah pauses, shyly. Mom and sister exclaim they know exactly what went into her rucksack first. The    takes a moment to rummage in her bag and produces her   item with a flourish    a military issue doll given to the girls when Nick went on his first tour.  ”Daddy doll!” The girls are carrying their   items, but one lesson Nicholle says she’s already learned from the exercise is to pack a little lighter. Although she’s a strong fitness instructor, she’s weighed down with over 150 pounds of luggage and it’s slowing her down.  A string of tents is pitched at Yongsan Garrison military base. There’s an icy wind and a trace of nervous anticipation in the air as families slowly gather.  This is the first time since 2010 the evacuation simulation has gone all the way to Okinawa. Most people aren’t really sure what to expect    they’ve just been told, ”it’s not going to be comfortable.” The group are issued with identity bracelets that will track their progress from South Korea to Okinawa. If this were a genuine evacuation, the families would then be flown back to the United States from Japan.  There is a security screening and the opportunity to register any pets traveling. The Martinez family joke that the fish didn’t make the cut. One stage of the registration process also includes instructions on the ICAPS mask    or Infant Chemical Agent Protective System    that protects against the effects of biological attacks for up to 12 hours.  There’s a lot of nervous laughter and ”Ghostbusters” references abound. Briannah gets into the spirit of things.  But for all the smiles and calm instruction, the vision of a 6   preparing for a chemical or biological attack isn’t a comfortable one. Nicholle, who herself was in the military police, says that as well as being a great life experience, it’s a good opportunity for the girls to get some insight into what dad does for a living. ”They only have five more years until dad retires,” she says. ”So being here has opened their eyes as to what military life is.”  Alannah is already showing signs of logistical aptitude. She tells me she’s not sure why they’d take so many steps to evacuate the country, if it really was an emergency. I suggest it might seem easier just to get families onto a commercial flight in Seoul.  ”That’s what I would do!” she says. ”Just get outta there.”  I put Alannah’s question to Sturn, who says the movement south would be in response to hostile maneuverings from the north and the ”need to move people out of that hotspot.” ”If it was a natural disaster, or something like that, we would absolutely fly them out of Seoul,” says Sturn. ”But this is the   scenario. And the   scenario is North Korea is coming across the border, and we need to get people out of harm’s way.” After about an hour’s drive in convoy from the registration point in Seoul, we arrive at Camp Humphreys, further south in Pyeongtaek. We’re taken through a hangar full of military hardware towards two US Army   or Chinook helicopters, sitting on the tarmac.  We’re given a safety orientation, issued earplugs and escorted on to the machine.  This is the first time most of the civilians have flown in a military helicopter. The roar, heat and pure force from the blades is overwhelming as we get on board.  If they had to evacuate by helicopter, this is a fair enactment of how it would go, says Col. Lance Calvert, commander of the 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade. However, with the increased numbers a   scenario would entail, he says there would be more practical ways to transport people out of Pyeongtaek. It’s estimated that    if this were a genuine evacuation of   from South Korea    the order could be for tens of thousands of civilians to leave over a period of five to seven days. ”Trains, buses or commercial transportation systems are much more efficient,” he says.  The aim of the drill isn’t only to try to give relatives a realistic practice run. The military also considers the ”mental aptitude” of a soldier in a crisis and believes exercising this process builds confidence. It shows acting service members that, in a dangerous situation, their family members would be cared for.  ”In a natural disaster or hostile scenario, the last thing you want is your soldier thinking about his family,’” says Capt. Jimmy Sheehan. The helicopters land in Daegu. After a mess dinner, we spend a chilly night in the dormitories on the US military base, Camp Walker. The next morning, we’re up at 5 a. m.  Despite the intensity and length of the journey so far, all the kids in the group are still in good spirits. A trip to Okinawa aquarium is nearly within grasp.  A convoy through the spectacular mountainous south takes us to Gimhae Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) base where we’re escorted on to a US Air Force   Hercules transport plane for the drill’s final leg    onwards to Japan.  The Hercules is an impressive beast, and the ” ” run into it in anticipation of arriving in warmer southern climes.  Earplugs at the ready, we’re strapped in. Most of the children curl up and nod off    an oddly peaceful scene in such a stark environment.  Landing in Japan is the highlight for the Martinez girls, who tell me with great enthusiasm how much they like exploring new places.   ”For some reason, I thought we were going to go on a secret subway tunnel!” says Alannah. Her younger sister interjects wistfully: ”I wish we could go through a tunnel to a magical place.”  ”Just close your eyes and imagine it,” laughs mom.  She says they seize these kinds of opportunities because, as a military family that’s often on the move, they try to make the best of it everywhere they go.  ”You adapt and you will succeed, or you will be miserable if you don’t,” she says. ”We embrace these kinds of events because we help our spouses. My husband benefits from us enjoying our time here. If we’re happy, he’s happy.” For Nicholle, the experience has also made her reflect on how an emergency evacuation would really feel. The idea of leaving all the material things behind isn’t difficult. ”The most important thing is that I get my girls to a safe place,”’ she says.  But it has driven home what, for her, would be the most painful part of the process. ”Knowing that I would be leaving my husband behind. .. that would be the hardest thing.”",Q1Z2017-01-03Z1Q

Business Insider,Q1ZBob Bryan,Q1ZThe number of new businesses in the US is collapsing — and that’s disastrous news for the economy,"Q1Z’  ’ ’   Possibly the defining business trend coming out of the financial   crisis has been a ”startup boom.” Everyone is building an app or   starting their own business it seems. ’ ’   This image, however, may be just an illusion, according to   Michelle Meyer, US economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ’ ”   Both the formation of firms (for example, McDonald’s as a whole)   and establishments (an individual McDonald’s restaurant) have   dropped off precipitously since the financial crisis and remained   low. ” ”   This is important, according to Meyer, because new businesses   typically hire faster and produce higher levels of productivity   than firms that have been around for a while. Thus the decline in   business formation can explain some of the labor market’s   postrecession problems, and is at least part of the reason for   the steep drop in productivity. ” ’  ’ ”   Additionally, Meyer says, it can end up affecting the nation’s   gross domestic product. Here’s Meyer (emphasis added): ” ’   Meyer suggests four reasons for this depressing economic trend: ’ ’   It is not all doom and gloom, however, Meyer says. For one thing,   credit access has gotten considerably easier, allowing new   businesses to take out loans. Business confidence is also a   cyclical trend that can be reversed. ’ ’   On the other two, Meyer notes that technological disruptions can   cut both ways. Additionally, millennials are hitting ”prime age,”   which means they have the capital and experience to take on a   business venture themselves. ’ ’   ”Research from the Kauffman foundation discovered that the   average successful entrepreneur in   industries founded   their company when they were 40 years old,” the note said. ”With   the oldest millennial just turning 36, demographics should turn   supportive for new business formation in the medium term.” ’ ”   So it’s not pretty for now, but entrepreneurship isn’t dead in   America yet. ”",Q1Z2016-09-17Z1Q
Business Insider,Q1ZMatthew DeBord,Q1ZSomething interesting — and possibly alarming — is happening with Tesla stock,"Q1Z’’ ”Investing in Tesla isn’t for the weak of will. ” ”Shares in the   automaker tend to be volatile, and on Wall Street there’s a chasm between the bulls and the bears as far as   go. Some have seen the stock plunging below $100, while others have argued that it could touch $500.” ’Through all this, Tesla has amassed a $30 billion market cap and with shares now trading around $200, the company has certainly rewarded early investors who bought after the 2010 IPO, when the stock traded for around $20.’ ”It’s worth it to have a look at Tesla’s stock charts from time to time, and with 2016 coming to a close, now is as good a moment.” ”Here’s a chart of the stock price over the past five years:” ’’ ’Shares really took off in 2013, and with some swoons along the way, peaked in fall of 2014. There was then a slide, followed by a recovery, then a big dip in 2015 before another recovery. Over the full   period, the return has been 525%.’ ’’ ”What we’ve been seeing since Tesla started to push back toward its   highs is a steady erosion, a grinding decline. The plunge hasn’t happened  —   as it did in early 2016.” ”And the stage isn’t really set for a big  . Tesla posted a profit in the   albeit a qualified one because it sold a lot of ZEV credits. The carmaker looks as if it’s on track to achieving the   of its 2016 guidance for vehicle deliveries, around 80, 000. The fourth quarter could be unprofitable, but Tesla’s cash burn actually seems to be slowing down as it ramps up production.” ”That all sounds good, unless you expect Tesla to surge back from a slide, as it did in 2015. That might not happen, as Tesla doesn’t have a new product launch  —   the Model 3   vehicle  —   until late 2017, with significant deliveries not arriving until 2018.” ”That means Tesla could be finding a level, with trading clustered around $200. Volatility could also ease, making the Tesla trade on both the short and the long side less exciting. But this could all vindicate what some analysts have argued is a sort of speed limit on Tesla’s   growth: the future is already priced into the stock, so buying now doesn’t present much upside, at least not right away.” ’The weird thing about Tesla is that for its entire history as a public company, it’’s only experienced two clearly ”mellow” periods: right after the IPO, when its stock went nowhere; and . .. maybe . .. now, into    2017. To my eye, this latest   episode correlates with Tesla becoming more of a ”normal” car company; the biggest challenge is to, you know, build the cars.’ ”But that’s a boring big challenge. And without some kind of Trumpian apocalypse on the horizon, with the market for electric car completely collapsing, that boredom could persist for a while.”",Q1Z2016-12-09Z1Q
Business Insider,Q1ZMaxwell Tani,Q1ZDemocrats think Trump won on economic issues — but exit polls offer a more complicated story,"Q1Z’  ’ ’   Hillary Clinton has laid the blame on her upset election   loss to Donald Trump on . ’ ’   ’ ’   ”The Democratic Party failed to offer a compelling jobs   message for everybody,” Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, an early   Clinton supporter, told Business Insider in a recent interview. ’ ’   Clinton ”did win Rhode Island by a couple digits,” she   added. ”But a lot of the areas that went for Trump in Rhode   Island are places where people are feeling like they’’re left   behind in this economy. And I think that as I’’m out and   about talking to Rhode Islanders, there’’s still a high degree of   anxiety about my economic future.” ’ ’   But while some Democrats  and  that prioritizes pocketbook   issues over identity politics, others point to data   suggesting a more complicated understanding of why Clinton failed   to win in the former Rust Belt states. ’ ’’ ’   An examination of the exit polls in  revealed that the economy was by far the most   important issue to votes. But those who reported the economy   as their top issue  —   at least in the abstract    —   believed that Clinton had a stronger message. ’ ’   In Michigan, 52% of voters said the economy was ”most   important issue facing the country,”   Clinton won by 6 points   among people who reported that the economy was the most important   issue, while Obama only won on that issue by   3 points.  ’ ’   In Pennsylvania, Clinton won by 4 points among the 56% of   voters who reported that the economy was most important   issue facing the country. In 2012, Romney won by 5 points   among the 61% of voters concerned most about the economy. ’ ’   The results were even more stark in Wisconsin. While about the   same percentage of voters said the economy was the ”most   important issue facing the country” in 2016 and 2012  —   55% and   56% respectively  —   Clinton won those voters by 11 points, while   Romney won on the issue by a single point in 2012. ’ ’   Matt McDermott, a senior analyst at Whitman Insight Strategies,   acknowledged that while Democrats ”need to do a better   job” of connecting with workers concerned about economic and   personal finance issues, ”it’’s not the reason Hillary   Clinton lost this election.” ’ ’   ”There’’s really no unifying ’’big picture’’ campaign fault that   emerges as the reason why she lost them,” McDermott said,   referring to the three states. ”In part, this is because these   three states were each handled in markedly different ways by the   Clinton campaign, and yet each was lost by an equally small   margin.” ’ ’   He added: ’ ”   But while voters in these states had more faith in Clinton   in the abstract, they were more attracted to individual   aspects of Trump’s economic message, including his vehement   opposition to the   Partnership, his vague promise to   bring back US manufacturing jobs and punish companies that   outsource jobs, and his criticism of immigrants living in the US   illegally. ” ’   Exit polls themselves can be unreliable. Those that   survey early voters are . And for those conducted   on Election Day, the exit polls  skew toward counties and precincts with higher   incomes and education levels. ’ ’   Yet the exit polls also offered other explanations for why voters   supported Trump over Clinton. ’ ’   Trump won overwhelmingly among voters in  and  who craved ”change,” which voters in both   states said was, in the abstract, the most important quality they   sought in a candidate. ’ ’   ”We don’’t live in a monocausal world  —   one answer will not   explain a phenomenon,” said Michael Traugott, a professor and   polling expert at University of Michigan. ”Clinton did not   deliver a sustained economic message, and doing a better job on   that cold have helped here win across the country and in those   three close states. But it’’s also true that if she traveled there   instead of elsewhere, or advertised on TV, or if there had been   no Comey letter, etc. she could have done better as well.” ’ ”   Many top Democrats and some polling analysts long dismissed   Trump’s early campaign boasts that he could carve a new   electorate through the Rust Belt. And in the end, whatever the   cause, it came back to bite them. ” ”   In July, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti rejected the idea that   Trump’s rhetoric and proposals on immigration will help him win   Rust Belt states. ” ’   During a conference call, he told Business Insider: ”Millennials,   younger Americans, even those who are Gen X overwhelmingly   support immigration reform, even in the most working class,   Midwestern, Rust Belt states.” ’",Q1Z2016-12-25Z1Q

Atlantic,Q1ZJames Fallows,"Q1ZWhy the Maker Movement Matters: Part 1, the Tools Revolution","Q1Z, I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. In the years when I was visiting and learning about factories in China, my dominant emotion was, I can’t wait to tell people about this! Of course everyone “knew,” in general terms, about the rise of Chinese manufacturing and the country’s role as    . But the experience of seeing the factories that turned out computers and smart phones and everything else was so different from hearing about “  Chinese sweatshops” that I thought, people really have no idea. Sure, low wages and    regulatory and environmental standards were big advantages. But it was mainly the speed of the industrial ecosystem in places like Shenzhen that was so amazing. And the density of all elements of the supply chain  —   if you needed a certain kind of keyboard or connector, there were five suppliers to choose from within an hour’s drive. And one more underappreciated element was essential: the new tools of connectivity and logistics that allowed a customer in Chicago to shop online for a smartphone, and have the customized specs conveyed instantly to a production line in China, where the order would be put together and then taken to the airport in Hong Kong for airfreight back to the U. S. These new tools really mattered: China had had low wages for a very long time (and they were beginning to rise fast in these factory zones) it had abused the environment for years (and was trying to clean up). But it was only the   of information and logistics that allowed Chinese factories to be so directly incorporated into the world    system. That’s the story I told nine years ago in “China Makes, The World Takes,” centered on a company that had pioneered this kind of connection. I have had a similar feeling in recent years as I’ve seen outposts of the “Maker Movement” across the United States: This matters! People should pay attention! In this and the next few dispatches I’ll explain why I think so, and give illustrations from Kentucky, Oregon, South Carolina, California, and elsewhere. I imagine that many readers might have heard of this movement or seen one of its Maker Faires. But my guess is that most people who aren’t directly involved think of it as fringe and      and hip rather than a serious economic, technological, and   force. I’ve come to disagree, and let me lay out some of the reasons why. First, the lay of the landscape: You can see information about the national Maker Faire cycle here, for information about shows and displays. The next big event on the calendar is the National Maker Faire, in DC two weeks from now. You can read here about MakerCon, which I’ve been to and enjoyed, and go here for Make: magazine, to which I subscribe. In two weeks the White House will have events for the National Week of Making, with more information here. Make: had a story on the Maker City Initiative here Peter Hirschberg has a speech explaining the concept here and the Institute for the Future had an early report here. Now, what this movement is and why it matters. Everyone who has heard a recent political speech, listened to a talk show, or looked at the “Made in China” labels in retail stores is familiar with the idea that “America doesn’t make things any more. ” There are obvious reasons, and some less obvious ones, why people feel this way. A certain kind of   production certainly has shifted from the rest of the world to China (and elsewhere) in the past generation. As economies get richer, the relative share of manufacturing in their output and their workforce inevitably goes down (as it does for farming —  even as absolute output in both categories keeps going up) because service sectors are growing faster. This is true even of economies which much more aggressive   industrial government policies and corporate practices, like Germany and Japan: And as manufacturing efficiency grows up, the share of manufacturing jobs goes down even faster than the output share. Everyone’s grandfather worked in a factory each generation, fewer do. So there is a real change —  fewer Americans have jobs in manufacturing —  that seems even larger than it is, because of the kinds of things America still makes. Consumers naturally mainly see consumer goods: TVs, electronics, gadgets, clothes. Those are the fields in which production has disproportionately shifted overseas. Walk into a WalMart or Costco, and just about everything seems to come from China. The   capital goods or scientific equipment from U. S. manufacturers rarely comes before our eyes. (The main exception is Boeing airplanes, with GE or Pratt  Whitney engines.) We see the “assembled in China” labels on Apple computers and phones and   what that means. The labels conceal the reality that the most valuable parts of a Mac or iPhone come not from China but from richer countries like Japan, Germany, South Korea, and very significantly from the United States. To wrap this up for now: yes, manufacturing is in relative decline across the developed world, although most Americans think the situation is worse than it really is. And yes, the decline of     manufacturing is part of the worsening pressure on   earners, also around the world. So anything that can spur new manufacturing is a plus —  with an emphasis on the new, given the repeated findings by the Kauffman Foundation that essentially all net job creation in the United States is from companies in their first few years of existence. (Explanation here. Short version: Older companies, in aggregate, gradually reduce their total workforce over time, as some go out of business and some get streamlined. Thus, the net job growth is from   companies.)   What might the maker movement have to do with that? It has made it surprisingly easier for new companies, in manufacturing, to start. Why? It has to do with tools. Here’s how I finally understood the difference that a new generation of production tools has made: by comparing it to my own business, writing and publishing. Everyone in journalism knows the line attributed to A. J. Liebling, in The New Yorker: “Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one. ” Liebling wrote that in 1960. As    recently as that in historical terms, if you wanted to disseminate your thoughts to people outside your household, you simply could not do it yourself. You had no option but to work through a limited number of powerful,   enterprises. You had to convince a newspaper or magazine to publish your writings —  because only they controlled the printing presses, delivery networks, and newsstands. (I remember the olden days of wanting to react to something in the news, and then making phone calls or sending letters —  ! !! yes, real letters in the mail on paper ! !! —  to the handful of gatekeepers who ran   pages, hoping you could get their interest.) You had to attract the attention of TV or radio reporters, since only they could get you on the air. If you had a longer story to tell, you had to convince a publishing house to put out your book. Short of going    with flyers, there was no way to avoid the middleman in this industry. And the people who served as middlemen —  the publishers, the broadcasters —  were buttressed by the very expensive printing and transmitting equipment they controlled. Wave after wave of disruption in publishing have been bad for everyone who used to hold that middleman role. (The Atlantic is doing very well right now —  so thanks for reading and subscribing!) But the new tools fostered an unprecedented outpouring of expression. Blogs, Tweets, YouTube videos, Instagrammed photos, podcasts, Reddit and Facebook communities, billions upon billions of daily texts messages   …     One by one many of these might be trivial and some of them destructive. But taken together they produced a totally different form of communication and knowledge, and countless millions of new business operations, all because an advance in production tools. There’s a similar   change whose effects are so profound that we never even think about them any more. In the early days of computer use and   if you wanted to write something electronically, you had to wrestle with a lot of the details of electronic life. The first computer I ever used, in the late 1970s, was one I bought from a   warehouse in Ohio I had to reprogram it to be able to use a writing program called The Electric Pencil. Now people may grumble about Word, Pages, and other programs, but using them requires about as much forethought as picking up a real pencil. In the early days of web design, to put anything online you had to know a lot about layout code. Including pictures, charts, videos, or sounds was so hard you generally didn’t bother. Now you copy an embed code, you click Share or Send or Upload, and the job is done. Tools that were unknown a generation ago are now ubiquitous and have changed everything about communication and expression. Something similar is fostering the maker movement. Since the dawn of the capitalist   era, to succeed in manufacturing you needed capital. You needed money for giant production equipment. Blast furnaces if you were making steel, assembly lines if you were making cars, machine tools if you were making engines, coordinated supply chains if you were assembling complex devices. Then you needed distribution arrangements with stores, and lots of inventory for them to keep in the warehouse, and other impediments that collectively made it hard, expensive,   and   for newcomers to enter a business. This is the equation that the tools revolution of the past few years is also changing for manufacturing. A combination of 3D printing (which allows people to make and revise prototypes onsite, and produce certain     items themselves, rather than going to a factory) much less expensive laser cutters, milling machines, and other sophisticated machine tools the evolution of Arduino controls, which allow designers to add sophisticated electronic functions without doing all the coding themselves. You could think of this last function as being similar to simple Embed functions for images or videos online. In parallel with these technological advances have been organizational changes. For instance, the rise of   and   site where people can use advanced machinery for free or at very low cost and the rise of collaborations among universities, community colleges, established companies, and local financiers in fostering hardware entrepreneurs. One of the most ambitions of those collaborative spaces is “Highway 1” in San Francisco. I wrote about its origins in the magazine back in 2012 you can read a report about its latest “Demo Day,” at which maker groups show off their products, in a TechCrunch story here and see a video here. This video from Highway 1 is obviously promotional, but it demonstrates the changes I am talking about and rings true to what I have seen and heard from entrepreneurs there (I have met and interviewed some of the people you see here). *** “This would not have been possible ten years ago,” Venkat Venkatakrishnan, the CEO of a unique and famous maker space called FirstBuild, told me in Louisville earlier this year. FirstBuild is unique because it was created by GE, as a subsidiary of its appliance division and as a deliberate effort to bring the nimble maker spirit to its design process. “What has changed is that the maker movement has figured out a group of technologies and tools which enable us to manufacture in low volume,” Venkat (as he is known) said. Big manufacturers like GE built their business on     very   production, where each new product means a bet of tens of millions of dollars. FirstBuild is mean to explore smaller, faster, more customizable options. “Now you can get a circuit board mill for $8, 000. If you are looking for a circuit board for an appliance, earlier the only chance of getting it was from China. Today I can make boards here and ship them out quickly. Similarly with laser cutters —  not big ones but small ones, where I can cut metal right here. It’s a huge advantage, and these things did not exist ten years from now. In those days you couldn’t hack the kind of creative solutions we are seeing now. ” Tomorrow FirstBuild and its parent GE Appliances division are expected to complete a   deal that will transfer ownership to the giant Chinese appliance maker Haier. (GE had previously planned to sell to the Swedish firm Electrolux, which has a much bigger presence in the U. S. market than Haier does, but it called off the deal last year after resistance from U. S.   regulators.) Both GE and Haier have said that that all factories and facilities will stay where they are (Electrolux had planned a move to its existing sites in North Carolina) that the GE Appliance and FirstBuild management will be unchanged and that the FirstBuild   mission will continue too. That’s the   corporate news. In the next installment, more details on exactly what FirstBuild has underway, how that parallels efforts in other parts of the country, and what this Maker energy might mean for the country’s ability to foster new companies and create better jobs.",Q1Z2016-06-05Z1Q
Atlantic,Q1ZRussell Berman,Q1ZBrownback Vetoes Medicaid Expansion in Kansas,"Q1ZGovernor Sam Brownback of Kansas on Thursday vetoed legislation expanding Medicaid passed with Republican majorities in the state’s House and Senate. Supporters of the bill are likely a few votes shy of the   majority needed to override Brownback’s veto. The move was expected, since Brownback has opposed expanding Medicaid for years. But the expansion effort could find new life if the governor leaves office before his term ends next year President Trump is reportedly considering an appointment for Brownback as U. N. ambassador for food agriculture, a posting that would take the   presidential candidate from Topeka to Rome. The States Where Obamacare’s Footprint Might Get Even Bigger, Kansas is one of several states that has moved toward accepting federal money to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act following the failure last week of   legislation in Congress to repeal the law. With support from Democrats, a coalition of moderate Republicans pushed Medicaid expansion through the state House on a   vote last month. The state Senate followed suit earlier this week, sending the measure to Brownback on a   vote. The bill was the latest salvo in the increasingly combative relationship between the conservative governor and the Republicans in control of the legislature. Lawmakers in Topeka nearly overrode Brownback’s veto earlier this year of legislation that would have reversed the steep tax cuts he enacted during his first years in office. Brownback’s popularity in Kansas has sunk as deficits in the state have ballooned, and at least one poll suggests his latest veto won’t help lift his support: The survey funded by the American Cancer Society, which backs expansion, found that 82 percent of respondents in the state favored accepting additional Medicaid money from Washington. In a veto message, Brownback said the cost of expanding Medicaid was “irresponsible and unsustainable” at a time when the state is dealing with an ongoing budget crisis. He cited a study finding that it would cost Kansas $1. 2 billion in the coming years, while supporters of the Medicaid bill have said the state is giving up an even higher amount in federal support without expansion. Brownback, who is staunchly opposed to abortion, also denounced the legislation for facilitating an increase in Medicaid reimbursements for Planned Parenthood, the women’s health nonprofit that performs abortions. Federal law already prohibits taxpayer funding of abortion, but conservatives have called for cutting off money to the organization nonetheless. “From its infancy, the state of Kansas has affirmed the dignity and equality of each human life,” he said in a statement. “I will not support this legislation that continues to fund organizations that undermine a culture of life. ” Finally, the governor argued that because Republicans in Congress are still discussing legislation that would repeal Obamacare, Kansas would put itself at risk by expanding Medicaid if that effort was successful. “Attempting to overhaul our current system while these changes are still being worked out is potentially harmful to our state,” Brownback wrote. Yet the threat of repeal was exactly why many Republicans wanted to move forward with expansion. “There’s the potential for this to go away,” David Jordan, executive director of the Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, told me. “We’re much better served by getting in under than being left behind, than being one of the   states. ” Brownback’s veto ensures Medicaid expansion in Kansas won’t happen immediately, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it won’t happen at all.",Q1Z2017-03-30Z1Q
Atlantic,Q1ZClare Foran,Q1ZWalking Away from Bernie Sanders,"Q1Z   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Bernie Sanders so far refuses to give up his fight for the White House. But in yet another sign that his campaign for president has stalled out, one of the Vermont senator s most loyal and prominent backers has announced his support for Hillary Clinton. Raul Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat and the first member of Congress to endorse Sanders, explained his reasoning in a statement: With voting completed in the final Democratic Primary, it is now time for the Democratic Party to unify. For all of us who supported Bernie from the beginning, whether we considered ourselves progressives or independents or just Americans tired of being on the outside looking in, the most important thing now is to beat Donald Trump in November. To use a word that s been thrown around a lot lately, now is the time to unify. [ ¦] Hillary Clinton has the capacity and the instincts needed to carry forward what has been started. I support her and will do what I can to help ensure her victory. I firmly believe that her victory will only come when she and the Democratic Party articulate the themes this movement [created by the Sanders campaign] has so powerfully expressed. That s an excerpt from a much longer set of remarks from the representative, reported by NBC News  Danny Freeman on Twitter. The declaration attempts to walk a very fine line. It emphasizes that the ideals and promises at the heart of Sanders s campaign have widespread support and must be taken seriously by the next president, while at the same time concedes that the next president will not, in fact, be Sanders. Many Sanders supporters, resigned to the fact that it now looks impossible for their candidate to win the White House, must settle for the next best alternative and hope that Clinton will champion the causes near and dear to the senator. It would be overly simplistic to describe Grijalva s remarks as a defection. Even in shifting support to Clinton, he wants to push her to embrace the Sanders agenda.  It won t be enough to just accept the merit of his ideas, ? Grijalva said.  This is in no small part Bernie Sanders  party also. His team, his supporters and his movement must ”and will ”be integrated into the future of the Democratic Party at every level. ? He warned:  Unity will not be realized if the millions of voters who supported Bernie Sanders feel taken for granted. ? Ultimately, however, there is no guarantee that the former secretary of state will take up that mantle. Still, to win in November, Clinton cannot afford to alienate the voters who have stood by Sanders. Her campaign is undoubtedly aware of that and is making an effort to act conciliatory. Earlier in the week, Sanders laid out a series of demands, ranging from a call for  the most progressive platform ever passed by the Democratic Party ? to changes to the presidential nominating process. After Sanders lost the final Democratic primary in Washington, D. C. on Tuesday, Clinton met with him to discuss what comes next. A spokesperson for Sanders called the meeting  a positive discussion ? in a statement, noting that  the two discussed a variety of issues where they are seeking common ground: substantially raising the minimum wage, real campaign finance reform, making health care universal and accessible, making college affordable and reducing student debt. ? But who s to say Clinton won t endorse the ideas Sanders has championed only to retreat from them later? For now, Sanders seems to believe the best way to push Clinton in the direction he wants to see her take the party is to remain in the race. The longer he does so, however, the more he risks losing leverage. Grijalva s declaration of support for Clinton is a painful reminder of the downward trajectory of the campaign. Not long ago, Jeff Weaver, Sanders s campaign manager, vowed to spend the weeks leading up to the Democratic National Convention, which will take place next month, attempting to win over party leaders known as superdelegates. Â The campaign no longer appears to be actively pursuing that strategy. Grijalva was one of the few superdelegates to support Sanders. Now the campaign has lost even him. Tonight, Sanders is expected to lay out the next steps for his revolution in a video address from Burlington, Vermont. His campaign has already signaled that he is unlikely to drop out. A spokesperson for the campaign told Bloomberg on Tuesday that Sanders would not exit the race  today, tomorrow, or the next day. ? The fact that he has so far stubbornly stuck in the race despite the fact that   voting has drawn to a close, with Clinton as the clear winner, is a testament to how much Sanders wants to see the changes he is calling for enacted. At the same time, it has become less clear how much leverage he actually has. If even his most ardent supporters decide to support Clinton before Sanders officially quits the race, his ability to wield influence over the party and the presidential race seems poised to diminish even further.",Q1Z2016-06-16Z1Q

Atlantic,Q1ZJeremy Laurance,Q1ZIndia’s Movement to Help People Die Better,"Q1ZA college professor aged 42 with cancer of the tongue had been referred to him by an oncologist. The man was in severe pain, and the anesthetist, M. R. Rajagopal, asked if he could help. He injected the mandibular nerve in the jaw in a procedure known as a nerve block, and told the patient to return in 24 hours. Next day, the pain had almost completely gone and Dr. Raj, as he is known, was pleased with his work. “He asked me when he should come back. I told him there was no need to come back, unless the pain returned. I thought he would be happy I had cured the pain. Instead, he went home and killed himself that night. ” It turned out that the oncologist had avoided explaining to the college professor that his cancer was terminal. Instead he had said he was referring him for further treatment. “It was only when I told him there was no need to come back that he realized his cancer was incurable. He went home and told his family it was all over. ” Dr. Raj reaches for a glass of water. We are sitting in his simple home in Trivandrum, the leafy state capital, where he now lives with his wife, Chandrika, a pathologist. In front of us, a plate of yellow jackfruit gleams in the low afternoon light. A fan whirrs above. That experience caused Dr. Raj to examine his own practice. In addition to putting people to sleep for surgery, an anesthetist’s job is to tackle pain. So what was he missing, he wondered. “In those days pain was all over the hospital. It was everywhere. We pretended not to see it, but it was there. Injections of morphine were used sparingly, after surgery and for patients injured in accidents. It was never used in cancer pain. ” Medical staff coped with the suffering the same way they cope everywhere. “No one teaches you, but you learn to see only the disease, not the human being who has it. Maybe if there is nothing you can do it is easier to turn your back. ” Dr. Raj had had two earlier traumatic experiences involving the dying. Aged 18, in his first year in medical school, he had lived close to a man who had terminal cancer of the sweat glands. “I would hear him screaming in the night. He had nodules all over his scalp. The family knew I was a medical student and asked if I could do anything. I didn’t know how —  I was helpless. I am ashamed that I never visited him after that. I did not want to go there and feel helpless again. ” Later, he was looking after a patient with a gangrenous toe who was in excruciating pain. “I asked my head of department if I could try a nerve block. He refused —  it was not part of routine care and there was a shortage of anesthetists. I had to tell the man there was nothing I could do. I still remember the look of hopelessness on his face. ” When he became head of department at Calicut, there was no one to tell him what he could and couldn’t do. That is how he came to treat the college professor. But his patient’s suicide showed him that treating the pain was not enough. “I realized that thinking about nerve blocks was too narrow. Pain is just the visible part of the iceberg of suffering. What is ignored is the part below the surface —  feelings of hopelessness and despair, worries about money, about children. That is what palliative care is about. That man gave up his life to help me understand it. ” * * * We all wish for a   dignified death. Too few of us achieve it. Worldwide, the last year of life is marked by widespread unnecessary suffering. At least 40 million people need palliative care each year, but only around half that number receive it, according to the Worldwide Hospice Palliative Care Alliance. India comes near the bottom of the global league in access to    care —  ranked 67 out of 80 countries in 2015 —  but Kerala is an exception. This small green and fertile state in the   has just 3 percent of India’s population but provides   of the country’s   services. These have developed over the last 20 years, driven by the local community and supported by a unique system of volunteers. Some claim it is Kerala’s strong ethos of community involvement that is the secret behind its palliative care provision, which would be difficult to replicate elsewhere. Dr. Raj, one of the drivers of the movement, disagrees. “Yes, of course the strength of the community is important. But is Kerala the only part of the world where there are compassionate people? Is Kerala the only place where people who may have gained material success then want to do something meaningful with their lives?” Now a youthful 69, he recognized early on that tackling pain and supporting the dying could not be achieved by medical staff alone. The need was too great. It would depend on harnessing the commitment of volunteers. In 1993, after he had attended a course run by an English nurse, Gilly Burn, he and his colleague Suresh Kumar established the Pain and Palliative Care Society in Calicut, a town in the north of Kerala, together with an activist friend, Ashok Kumar, who ran a printing business and provided a vital layman’s perspective. “Six of us put in 250 rupees each, worth about £10 then,” says Dr. Raj. “We found two volunteers, young women with children at school, to register patients and sit and talk to them. Then I would come after work to see them. ” The project took off after Burn, who ran a trust, Cancer Relief India, donated 100, 000 rupees (£4, 000 in the  ) enabling them to appoint their first doctor. Calicut hospital provided two nurses. “It very quickly got attention. In the hospital, we were working in a sea of suffering. But in the clinic, you could see people smiling, talking, finding comfort. ” Within a year, it was being copied —  by a medic whom Dr. Raj met on a train and by a former student who wanted to open a clinic in his own town. The ball was rolling. There was a limitation, however. It was exposed early on when a young man came begging for help for his mother, who was in severe pain. She lived in a remote spot where there was no road and could not be moved. When Kumar told the man that the doctors could not prescribe without seeing the patient, he broke down in tears. Kumar weakened and told the man someone would come. It was their first home visit. Gradually demand increased. Then someone donated a vehicle. The doctors, working in their spare time, could not meet the demand alone. The organization of the clinics and the home visits depended on volunteers. But the volunteers also provided the link between their communities and the service —  they knew who was sick and where to get help. Over time, they became more and more involved. Some assisted with nursing tasks, following brief training, but most provided social care —  advice, support, a shoulder to cry on. By 2000, there were 30 palliative care groups in northern Kerala, run by volunteers and supported by mobile medical teams. Today, though there are no official figures, Dr. Raj estimates there are 300 voluntary groups across the state, providing care to patients in their own homes, identifying those in need, and helping to direct limited medical resources to where they can do the most good. Kerala is now a World Health Organization demonstration site for palliative care and plays host to a stream of international visitors wishing to learn how it was done. The strength of the groups is that they have grown organically, rooted in their communities, by popular demand, and thus have strong local support. They are largely funded by local donations, some as little as 10 rupees (12 pence) a month. They supplement the work of the 167 institutions licensed to dispense morphine and the 900 government —  funded panchayats, or village councils, each of which employs a nurse who provides palliative care —  though they may visit patients only once a month. * * * Thirty kilometers outside Trivandrum, in the district of Uzhamalakkal, the white van carrying the community team turns off the road and bounces along a rutted track to a group of houses   in the rubber trees. The team of doctor, nurse and volunteers enter a house where Surendran, a former rubber tapper aged 50, is lying on a bed naked to the waist, his lower body covered by a striped cloth. His chest rattles, his   arms are drawn up to his face and his breath comes in painful rasps. He is in the terminal stages of lung cancer, and for the last week has been unable to swallow —  food, liquid or morphine tablets. A Josco Jewellers calendar hangs on the bare cement walls, under a strip light, and a blanket covers the window. Mini, his wife, stands at the foot of the bed. Dr. Raj lays a hand on Surendran’s arm and gently explains that, as he can not swallow, to treat his pain the morphine will have to be administered rectally. The nurse will teach Mini how to do it. Dr. Raj asks if he has any questions. “Can I get out of this?” Surendran says. Before Dr. Raj can answer, Mini intervenes: “Yes of course you can. You will get better. ” Dr. Raj suspects she knows the truth, but decides against trying to broach it with her at that point, worried about the reaction it might provoke. Just as a wrong dose of a drug can harm, so can an   word, he says later. A reflective man, with kind eyes and neat moustache, he comes ever ready to lay a soothing hand on a fevered brow. Wearing a blue   shirt and sandals, his gentle demeanor and soft voice put patients at their ease while he gently probes for their stories before quietly instructing his team, who hang on his words. “We help people live at home and die at home. Most want that,” he says. But Surendran’s condition is extreme, and his suffering severe, so Dr. Raj urges Mini to bring him to the city, where there are a few   beds. She says she can not leave her    daughter alone, so Dr. Raj suggests bringing her too. While neighbors are often supportive, in this case they stopped visiting when they heard Surendran had cancer. Mini says she will consider it. The volunteers will help arrange transport. The group that requested the home visit, called Sangamam (meaning “confluence”) was started four years ago by Dileep, 43, the manager of a paint shop, whose wife died of cancer. It is one of 11 that have sprung up in the Trivandrum area in the last decade. They are supported by Pallium India —  the organisation Dr. Raj founded in 2006 after he retired from the government medical service and moved to the city —  which provided the mobile medical team. Sangamam is one of the most successful groups, with 12 active volunteers and another 50 whose help can be drawn upon. It is funded by donations from the local community. In this case, friends have been generous enough to allow Dileep to hire a nurse and buy some land, where he hopes to construct a clinic. The local panchayat gives 50, 000 rupees a year for drugs. “Because they are convinced we are doing good work,” Dileep says. Guided by the Sangamam volunteers, the Pallium India team sees two more cases this Tuesday morning in January. One, a woman of 55, who had her tongue removed a month previously because of cancer, has developed severe pains in her neck, which prevent her sleeping. Wearing a pink sari, she breaks down in tears as it emerges from Dr. Raj’s careful questioning that she has argued with her son in a dispute over land, and he has left. Sobha, a volunteer, has learned from neighbors that the son is planning to get married but has not told his mother. She undertakes to contact him to try to negotiate a reconciliation. Palliative care, in this conception, is about tackling emotional pain, as well as the physical kind. * * * What Kerala has recognized, though the rest of the world has been slow to do so, is that the scale of the need for palliative care cannot be met by professionals alone. In the U. K. the hospice movement provides the gold standard for    care. Yet just 4 percent of deaths occur in hospices. Most people —  over   in some surveys —  say they would prefer to die at home, but less than a quarter do so. Julia Riley, consultant at the Royal Marsden Hospital, London, and visiting professor at the Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College, says: “Hospices do terrific things —  but there are not enough of them. We have got to get the service out into the community —  it can be done at home. Only 10 percent of people who are terminally ill need specialist palliative care. The rest need only generic care. “Palliative care is so cheap. We can do so much, relative to other areas of medicine, for so little. Giving people a dignified death is so important —  both for them and for their families. ” In the U. K. the number of deaths is rising as the postwar baby boomers age, says Max Watson, consultant in palliative care at the Northern Ireland Hospice and visiting professor at the University of Ulster. “To continue in the way we are —  relying on hospices and specialist care —  isn’t an option,” he says. “It is really important to democratize specialist knowledge. We need to engage carers, voluntary groups, nursing homes and patients themselves so they can be empowered to provide      care. Most of those helping are over 60 themselves. They are a fantastic resource we are not using properly. ” In the U. S. hospice care is more widespread —  45 percent of Americans at the end of their lives in 2010 received hospice care, more than half of them at home. These are among the highest rates in the world, according to Atul Gawande in his book Being Mortal. However, spending on the U. S. health system is widely acknowledged to be out of control, substantially outstripping the costs of comparable systems in Europe. The Kerala model is thus drawing attention from around the world. The estimated 300 voluntary groups are often described as a network. This suggests, wrongly, that there is some overarching organization that links them all. In truth they are a series of networks that have grown organically, from the ground up, wherever the community has decided there is a need. One of the biggest is the Neighbourhood Network in Palliative Care in northern Kerala, led by Suresh Kumar, Dr. Raj’s former colleague. In Trivandrum, Pallium India, staffed by six doctors, five social workers and 20 nurses, provides five mobile medical teams to support the 11 local groups. It also runs an outpatient clinic and an inpatient unit with 17 beds at Arumana hospital in the city, and provides outpatient services at four government hospitals. In 2016, the mobile teams made 6, 397 home visits. Some patients are starving and Pallium India currently provides 225 families with a monthly food kit, containing basic supplies, and supports the education of 300 children, in addition to supplying free drugs. * * * The work of creating the voluntary groups starts with talking to local people, explaining that hospitals are no place for the dying and that caring for the terminally ill is the community’s responsibility. The concept of palliative care has been extended to include the chronically ill and the paraplegic, such as stroke survivors and people with complications of diabetes, including blindness and amputation, who now constitute up to half the patients. Once a group is formed, Pallium India encourages the organisers to register it —  for the sake of transparency and to gain tax advantages on donations —  and offers support with regular visits from a doctor or nurse. But the aim is that the groups should ultimately go it alone. Their origin in the communities they represent is their strength. But the absence of any   organisation is also a weakness. It means there is no mechanism for spreading the concept to other parts of Kerala, or other parts of India. Organic growth is slow growth. Out of frustration with the lack of progress, Dr. Raj established Pallium India to act as an agency to spread palliative care more widely, beyond the state’s borders. “What has happened in Kerala is beautiful. But it should not be stuck in Kerala. It could be 1, 000 years before we get universal pain relief [across India],” he says. With the help of grants from foundations, donations from   and support from the Tata group, Pallium India has established 23 palliative care centres across India by providing initial funding to interested groups, training doctors and nurses, and giving support. Kerala has been a pioneer in other ways. Its government launched the first state Palliative Care Policy in 2008. Two other states, Maharashtra and Karnataka, have followed suit and a National Palliative Care Strategy for India was published in 2012. A working group appointed by Pallium India drew up a list of essential standards, including a minimum 10 days’ training in palliative care for doctors and nurses, an uninterrupted supply of morphine, and documentation of patients’ pain scores. But Dr. Raj, who lobbied for the strategies, is not satisfied. “I am upset when the palliative care community boast about what we have achieved. We are not doing nearly enough.   percent of people in India do not get access to palliative care. ” He paused to reconsider this bleak assessment. “Okay, if I want to be optimistic, I can put it another way. One percent of people do have access to palliative care. That is 12 million people. ” * * * Central to the provision of care for the dying is the alleviation of pain. But even this is not being satisfactorily achieved. India is the world’s largest legal producer of opium for medical purposes. But most is exported to the West. Over 90 percent of the world’s morphine consumption is in the countries of North America and Europe. All   and   countries combined consume just 6 percent. Morphine is easy and cheap to produce. It is not the cost that restricts access, but the law. Morphine has been highly restricted in India since 1985. As a result, two generations of doctors have grown up unfamiliar with it. Misplaced fears about drug abuse have condemned millions of terminally ill patients to an unnecessarily painful death. Kerala has again proved more enlightened than other Indian states. Since 1998, palliative care centres in Kerala have been permitted to administer the drug orally. Much more recently, in 2014, the law was finally relaxed to allow access to morphine across India. But Dr. Raj is again unimpressed. “Changing the law is not translated into practice unless someone is pushing it. The new law has not had a big effect. Figures show India uses 320 kilograms of morphine a year. To meet the need we would need to use 30, 000 kilograms. ” He added: “This is why it is vital to seize this moment, when the iron is hot. If we do not act now, it may be too late. ” * * * Volunteers are the linchpin of the Kerala model. Krishnaraj Manikoth, a retired chartered accountant who now helps at Arumana hospital, says the work offers a sense of purpose. “I worked for 30 years in Dubai. I had a comfortable life, two wonderful children —  I was blessed. What bothered me was that I had not done anything for society. I wanted to give something back. ” Sintu Suresh, a former journalist and speechwriter whose father died a painful death in an   unit, says she wanted to protect others from overtreatment. “Doctors don’t see the whole patient, the human being. They see only the disease,” she says. “I begged those treating my father to give him something for the pain. I told them they could keep sending the same bills but to stop torturing him. Only on the last day did they mention palliative care. ” In the U. K. it has been estimated that there are more than 100, 000 volunteers working with hospices (and nearly 500, 000 in the U. S.). Few, however, visit patients in their homes. An exception is the Hospice Neighbours scheme run by St. Nicholas Hospice in Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk. Established in 2011, the service helps between 120 and 150 people with terminal illnesses in their homes at any one time, supported by more than 150 volunteers who provide comfort, companionship and assistance with household tasks. The scheme, started by chief executive Barbara Gale, won the Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service in 2014. Gale interviewed 16 volunteers for a paper published in BMJ Supportive and Palliative Care in 2015. She found what chiefly motivated them was the opportunity to “make a difference. ” Many said they found the patients “inspiring,” death became “less scary” and the experience made them think differently about life. * * * Death and dying are taboo topics in many countries. Essential medicines are in short supply and there is little spending on palliative care research. Dying is seen as a failure of the health system to successfully cure. The pain of dying is compounded when families desperate to find a cure but ignorant of the poor prognosis are aided by doctors ready to impose high charges for ever more interventionist, but useless, treatments. The result is increased suffering for the patient and often penury for the surviving relatives. The Kerala model helps protect its citizens from the excesses of the medical system by enlisting the support of the community to comfort the dying, enabling the terminally ill to be cared for at home, where most prefer to be, and providing support to bereaved families in their hour of loss.

S. soil since 2001, the data shows America has been facing a steady stream of plots. For the period September 2001 through 2014, data shows the U. S. successfully prosecuted 580 individuals for terrorism and   cases. Further, since early 2014, at least 131 individuals were identified as being implicated in terror. Across both those groups, the senators reported that at least 40 people initially admitted to the U. S. as refugees later were convicted or implicated in terror cases.  Among the 580 convicted, they said, at least 380 were  . The top countries of origin were Pakistan, Lebanon and Somalia, as well as the Palestinian territories. Both Sessions and Cruz sit on the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, which compiled the   information based on data from the Justice Department, news reports and other   information. The files were shared with FoxNews. com. The files include dates, states of residence, countries of origin for   suspects, and reams of other details.  Specifically, they show a sharp spike in cases in 2015, largely stemming from the arrest of suspects claiming allegiance to the Islamic State. They also show a heavy concentration of cases involving suspects from California, Texas, New York and Minnesota, among other states. EXPLORE THE DATA IN THE MAPS AND CHARTS BELOW, The senators say the   repository still is missing critical details on suspects’ immigration history, which they say the Department of Homeland Security has “failed to provide. ” Immigration data the senators compiled came from other sources. Sessions and Cruz asked the president in their letter to order the departments of Justice, Homeland Security and State to ”update” and provide more detailed information. The senators have sent several letters to those departments since last year requesting immigration histories of those tied to terror. “The administration refuses to give out the information necessary to establish a sound policy that protects Americans from terrorists,” Sessions said in a statement to Fox News.  Asked about the complaints, DHS spokeswoman Gillian M. Christensen told FoxNews. com the department “will respond to the senators’ request directly and not through the press. ” “More than 100 Congressional committees, subcommittees, caucuses, commissions and groups exercise oversight and ensure accountability of DHS and we work closely with them on a daily basis. We’ve received unprecedented requests from a number of senators and representatives for physical paper files for more than 700 aliens,” she said, adding that officials have to review each page manually for privacy and other issues.   Cruz ran unsuccessfully this year for the Republican presidential nomination. Sessions, an ardent critic of the administration’s immigration policies, is supporting presumptive GOP nominee Trump. The allegations detailed in the subcommittee’s research pertain to a range of cases, involving suspects caught traveling or trying to travel overseas to fight, as well as suspects ensnared in controversial sting operations which   groups including the ACLU have criticized. In a 2014 report, Human Rights Watch said nearly half of the federal counterterror convictions at the time came from “  cases,” many of them sting operations where the informants played a role in the plot. The report said: “In some cases the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have created terrorists out of   individuals by conducting sting operations that facilitated or invented the target’s willingness to act. ” But even in some of those cases, federal agents got involved after learning of a serious suspected plot. In the case of the Seattle suspect, Abu Khalid   authorities said he approached someone in 2011 about attacking a military installation. That citizen alerted law enforcement and worked with them to capture Latif and an accomplice.  FoxNews. com’s Liz Torrey contributed to this report.    ",Q1Z2016-06-22Z1Q
Fox News,Q1ZHoward Kurtz,"Q1ZObama sells optimism, and Hillary, but can he stop Trumpism?","Q1ZBut when the president finally got around to saying he would pass the baton to Hillary Clinton —  and got a long hug from his   successor —  he created a   moment that rocked the Democrats here in Philadelphia. Whether he swayed voters wary of his former top diplomat is another question. What Obama was determined to do was create an optimistic and uplifting vision of America to contrast with what he and his party see as the dark and dangerous outlook of Donald Trump. And he warned the country not to fall under the sway of “homegrown demagogues. ” It is personal between Obama and Trump, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Ever since the billionaire went through his birther period, Obama has relished opportunities to punch back. Naturally he wants to preserve his legacy by ushering in four more years of Democratic rule, but he will take a special pleasure in denying The Donald a chance to live in the house he now occupies. After nearly eight years, Obama had to admit that he had made mistakes. That Hillary had made mistakes. That that is the price of working for change. The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage → He certainly erased memories of what bitter rivals they were eight years ago. Obama had to grapple with how long his   successor has been on the stage: “Look, Hillary’s got her share of critics.  She’s been caricatured by the right and by some folks on the left accused of everything you can imagine  —   and some things you can’t.  But she knows that’s what happens when you’re under a microscope for 40 years. ” Obama spent too much time defending his record he’s never running for office again. But rather than train too much firepower on Trump the man, as Joe Biden did earlier, he attacked Trumpism, saying America is better than that. But as a way to motivate disaffected Democrats, he also warned that Trump could win. In the end, Obama made his appeal about the voters, not himself, and not even his   of State. “Time and again, you’ve picked me up,” he said. “I hope, sometimes, I picked you up, too.  Tonight, I ask you to do for Hillary Clinton what you did for me. ” Obama’s popularity has ticked up during this campaign, perhaps because the two nominees have such high negatives, perhaps because the economy is improving. But it has never been easy for one politician to transfer his popularity to another. Obama, who began by recalling his “no red   blue states” speech of 2004, has failed most fundamentally on that score. The country is more polarized and divided than when he took office, as he has ruefully acknowledged. If enough voters buy the more optimistic picture being painted by Obama and Clinton, then she will break the ultimate glass ceiling. But if their words sound empty to enough Americans who are angry and frustrated with politics as usual, even Obama’s oratorical skills will be unable to stop Trump.

Fox News,Q1ZDana Blanton,Q1ZFox News Poll:  Fewer Americans feeling proud,"Q1Z The number of Americans proud of their country has dropped significantly in the last five years, according to the latest Fox News Poll. Pride is down 19 percentage points:  69 percent of voters were proud of America in 2011.  It’s 50 percent today.   And 46 percent say they aren’t proud, up from 28 percent. Even so, more voters feel proud than think the Founders would be. When asked how the Founding Fathers would feel if they could see the country today, just 19 percent think they would be proud.  That’s also down    it was 26 percent in 2011.   Three quarters (75 percent) say the Founders wouldn’t be proud of the nation.

See Latest Coverage → CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL POLL RESULTS, Among just those who themselves are proud, only 35 percent think the Founders would be. The decline in pride of country is identical among men and women (  points).  The downward shift is larger among Republicans (  points) than independents (  points) and Democrats (  points). Today, half of men (51 percent) and women (49 percent) are proud, as are 59 percent of Democrats, 49 percent of independents and 41 percent of Republicans. As the Fourth of July nears, roughly    voters say both major party presidential candidates are patriotic.  Sixty percent think Democrat Hillary Clinton is and 63 percent believe Republican Donald Trump is. It’s no surprise most Democrats say Clinton is patriotic (88 percent) and most Republicans think Trump is (84 percent).   Independents are much more likely to feel Trump (69 percent) is patriotic than Clinton (49 percent).   percent of voters backing Clinton are proud of the country, while just 39 percent of those supporting Trump feel that way.

Fox News,Q1ZChris Stirewalt,Q1ZPodesta backs bid to overturn electoral vote,"Q1Z On the roster: Podesta backs bid to overturn electoral vote   Key dates in Russian involvement in 2016 campaign   GOP Senators want clarity from Tillerson on Putin ties   Audible: Like, duh   Bag men  PODESTA BACKS BID TO OVERTURN ELECTORAL VOTE This whole “stages of grief” thing doesn’t seem to be working for some Democrats.  John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chairman and the victim of the most famous hack since Jennifer Lawrence, has joined the call from some members of the Electoral College that they be made privy to the secret findings of the intelligence community about Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.  The hope of the electors, led by Christine Pelosi, daughter of the House minority leader, is that the information would cause   electors to break from the popular vote in their states.  While conservatives may be cheered to see the sudden swell of support for federalism and republicanism on the left, that’s not really what’s cooking here.  It’s been more than a month since Trump pulled off a stunning upset to win the presidency, but some still refuse to accept what happened.  Even before the electoral uprising gained steam today, Democrats were looking for a   reboot. Since the revelation Friday that the CIA concluded Russia was trying to help Trump and hurt Clinton, “#revote” has been bouncing around the internet.  Trump’s win is hard for many Democrats to accept, especially given the fact that Clinton won the popular vote by about 2. 8 million votes, but  …    come on, people.  No one, not even the strongest Russophobe, has suggested that there was any interference in the election by the Kremlin. While only the most chronic consumers of Putin propaganda would say there was no Russian effort to interfere with the campaign, there is no credible reason to believe that Russia messed with any ballots, rigged any vote totals or anything of the like.  Russia obviously meddled in the campaign. There’s no evidence that Russia interfered with the election.  And that was hardly unknown.  In his statement, Podesta complained that despite the Clinton campaign’s “protestations, this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media. ”  That would be a novel standard for the government to use when risking prejudicing the views of the members of the Electoral College: Damaging topics to one candidate lacked sufficient media coverage.  Whether it was supporting WikiLeaks, doing the actual hacking of Democratic emails, as intelligence agencies say, or the origination of deceptive propaganda posing as news, the Kremlin clearly wasn’t ignoring the U. S. election.  It was a major theme in the campaign and the subject of hundreds of news stories. Clinton even brought it up in their second debate. After all, we’ll never forget that sterling bit of repartee: “You’re a puppet. ”  It would fine for an elector to vote his or her conscience in contradiction of the voters and to face the consequences under their state’s law. It might even be a refreshing blast of federalism.  But saying that you were going to break the law of your state and vote for someone the voters rejected on the grounds that not enough attention was paid to a topic kind of defeats the purpose of having voters.  You could say the same thing about public awareness and media coverage of lots of topics as Podesta  Co. are now saying about Russia meddling.  Another 100 stories about Trump’s sketchy charitable donations or treatment of women might have tipped the narrow votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Or maybe they wouldn’t have. But it’s all over now, Baby Blue.  A bad guy wanted Trump to win. There were probably other bad guys and gals who wanted Clinton to win. Team Putin meddled as they were able, a fact perhaps not fully explored but hardly unknown. That’s not cause for a revote or electoral usurpation.  Trump and many Republicans are particularly sensitive about the Russian stuff because of the aforementioned popular vote minority but also because of the now obviously real effort to overturn the outcome.  In his interview with Chris Wallace, Trump flatly dismissed notions that the Russians did mischief during the campaign, and said that it was just Democrats making excuses.  One understands Trump’s sensitivity, given the ongoing effort to deprive him of his prize. But Republicans should remember that but both things can be true: Democrats can be   the significance of Russian interference, while still allowing the fact that the Russians interfered.  As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said today, Putin’s Russia is not a friend to the U. S. McConnell promised to back every real effort to find out what the Kremlin was, and is, up to.  If Democrats are sincere about wanting to root out Russian interference, they’d better quite exploiting the issue in such dangerous ways.  Clinton has, frankly, no excuse for losing the election, given her advantages. Russia made life harder on her, perhaps. But the presidency was not stolen.  Her campaign chairman trying to overturn the outcome is worse than sour grapes. It does exactly what Putin is hoping and further undermines confidence in the system.  KEY DATES IN RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT IN 2016 CAMPAIGN    14: DNC learned that Russian hackers gained access to their system and stole opposition research on Donald Trump.     22: WikiLeaks releases 22, 000 DNC emails on the eve of the party’s convention that show the inner workings of the organization and lead to   Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s termination.     29: Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also confirms it was hacked in a similar style to that of the DNC.    . 7: Director of National Intelligence James Clapper says in a speech at the Intelligence and National Security Summit that the Russians hack U. S. systems all the time, but declined to blame them directly for the DNC leaked emails.     7: Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security issued a joint statement stating that the U. S. Intelligence Community, which includes 16 agencies, was “confident” the hacking of the various branches of Democratic Party organizations were backed by the Russian government.  Also on Oct. 7, WikiLeaks releases its first round of top Clinton aide John Podesta’s personal emails.     20: Private security group concludes Podesta was hacked by Russian foreign intelligence service, the GRU, after tricking him into clicking on a fake Google login page to give his credentials in March 2015.    . 17: Clapper says his office and fellow agencies waited four months after news of the hack to release a statement because they wanted sufficient evidence before making an accusation against Russia.    . 30: Seven members of the Senate Intelligence Committee send a letter to President Obama requesting more information on the hack.    . 9: President Obama announces a “full review” of any   hacking.  THE RULEBOOK: MADE FOR YOU “This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties. ”  —   John Jay, Federalist No. 2  TIME OUT: WISDOM OF THE AGES Can a pretend city help suffering people recover real memories?

Recently, the George G.

Hostile powers do that to each other. And certainly we can see with the sources of propaganda aimed at American news consumers and support for Wikileaks efforts, Putin was trying to shape the discussion here.

It’s possible, of course, that they are lying or wrong. That could always be true of any government agency.

New   plastic surgeon Dr. John Mesa has performed Scrotox on 15 men in the past year alone, although he calls the procedure ‘ball ironing,’ according to Men’s Health. The effect of Scrotox is much the same as regular Botox (or ironing, for that matter): the removal of wrinkles, and the effect lasts for about four months. ”  Chris Stirewalt is politics editor for Fox News.

Fox News,Q1ZBlanche Johnson,Q1ZKelly Ripa will not return to ‘Live!’ until Tuesday,"Q1Z   Kelly Ripa is staying far away from the ”Live!” set in the coming days.   She was a no show on Wednesday following the announcement that   Michael Strahan is leaving the series in favor of ”Good Morning America,” and she will remain off the air until at least Tuesday.   A spokesperson for the show told E! Wednesday afternoon: ”On tomorrow’s ’Live! with Kelly and Michael,’ Erin Andrews will guest   with Michael Strahan. Friday’s show —  which already was scheduled to   on Thursday —  also will be   by Andrews.   ”Kelly Ripa will be out on Friday and Monday for a   vacation. On Monday’s show, Michael will be joined by ’Pretty Little Liars’ star Shay Mitchell. ”   On Thursday morning, Strahan walked out on the set    with Andrews. “Filling in for Kelly today is the one and the only Erin Andrews everybody,” he said enthusiastically at the start of the show.   Pop culture expert, Cate Meighan believes Strahan’s departure could lead to even more buzz than Ann Curry’s ousting from the ”Today” show in 2012.   Curry gave a tearful goodbye after 15 years on the show and many believe   Matt Lauer was the instigator behind her departure from the show.   “This is certainly beginning to look like it could even surpass the   feud that hovered over NBC for more than a year,” she explained. “Up until now Kelly Ripa has always been a team player and her loyalty to ABC and the ‘Live!’ has been unshakable. The fact that she has dug in her heels and decided to sit out taping her own show sends a clear message that she’s finished playing nice and no one really knows what that looks like because Ripa has never done it before. ”   Dan Gainor, VP of business and culture for the Media Research Center, added that the current tension between Ripa and ABC could even make the media mess even harder to clean up.   “Ripa is ’beyond angry’ at her own employer, never a good place to be,” he said. “Strahan, on the other hand, got moved to a more prominent gig on ‘GMA,’ so he has to be loving life. And, oddly, Ripa’s anger is making his move seem even more important. ”   On Wednesday’s show, Strahan took a moment to thank ‘Live!’ and address his move to “GMA. ”   “To all our viewers . .. you still continued to give us your eyeballs and watch this show,” he said. ”Thank you guys . .. I can’t ask for better fans  …     I’m always available to guest   . .. I’m not going anywhere.”   And Strahan continued to thank Ripa in his speech. ”Kelly, I thank you. I love you and everyone else here at ‘Live! ,’ and I’m not going to cry on TV momma, I promise you. ”   Oprah Winfrey told ET at an event in NYC that the sudden change was not properly handled.   ”Nobody should ever be blindsided,” she said. ”I don’t know who’s in charge, but somebody should’ve said, ’This is gonna happen.’ You shouldn’t have to read it in the paper. Ever.”   TMZ reports Disney CEO Bob Iger orchestrated Strahan’s move to ”GMA” to help shore up the show’s sagging ratings. However, there are also talks that “GMA” could be considering adding a third hour and knocking “Live!” off altogether.   Ripa, who just celebrated 15 years on ‘Live!’ in February, is currently making a reported $20 million a year.   Meighan explained that Ripa had nothing to lose by not showing up Wednesday if ABC does intend to move forward with an extra hour for “GMA. ”   “Supposedly ABC’s investment in GMA may mean nixing ‘Live!’ in favor of another hour of their morning show, with Strahan holding down the fort,” she said. “If there is any truth to that then Ripa may feel like she has nothing to lose in not showing up for her show. ABC has already proven that whatever their plan is, she and the rest of the ‘Live!’ crew are not a part of it. ”   Fans on social media defended Ripa’s decision to stay home on Wednesday, still outraged by the move.

There are about 7. 3 billion people on earth who would love Kelly Ripa’s career problems and salary right now. It’s time for her to grow up. ”   Request for comment from Ripa, Strahan and ABC have yet to be returned.

Talking Points Memo,Q1ZKristin Salaky,Q1ZConway Denies That She Is ’The Darkness’ In ’Democracy Dies In Darkness’ (VIDEO),"Q1ZRiffing off The Washington Post’s new slogan, “Democracy Dies In Darkness,” journalist Michael Wolff asked President Donald Trump’s senior counselor Kellyanne Conway if she takes personally the fact that she is “the darkness. ” “How personal do you take this?” Wolff asked Wednesday during a conversation at the Newseum in Washington D. C. “How personally do I take what?” Conway asked. “This coverage of you this ‘Democracy Dies In Darkness” because I’m gonna tell you, when they say ‘Democracy Dies In Darkness’ you’re the darkness,” Wolff said to cheers. “I’m not the darkness,” Conway shot back. Wolff clarified that he was not calling Conway “the darkness,” but pointing out that is probably what the Washington Post had in mind. Conway said that just because someone says something, doesn’t make it true. The comment came in a forum about the press and the presidency, which Conway participated in. Unsurprisingly, most of the questions volleyed at her had to do with the administration’s distrust of the media. At one point, Conway took a shot at television news, saying that anyone can go on TV and say anything, even if it’s not true. “People literally say things that just aren’t true,” Conway said to laughs from the audience. Conway has a complicated relationship with television news. Once a frequent face on the air, she has been largely absent following several   “alternative facts. ” It’s not clear if she has removed herself from cable news appearances or if more network shows are following in line with “Morning Joe,” who refuse to have Conway as a guest.

Talking Points Memo,Q1ZMatt Shuham,"Q1ZGOP Rep Skipped Town Halls Because Of Disruption, ’Criminal Element’","Q1ZA Republican congressman from Alabama said he would not hold town halls that were open to the public because of what he described as ”different elements from the Democratic Party” who had disrupted his colleagues’ events. MSNBC’s Kate Snow asked Rep. Mo Brooks ( ) Monday why he had refused, as reported by AL. com, to hold any public town halls during the recent congressional recess. “That gets into a definitional thing. What is a town hall?” Brooks asked. “I went to Huntsville High School in my district. I also went to a local company, Lasertel, and we had a town hall type format, where I give a Washington update and then questions and comments, whatever comes at me from people who are there. ”  According to AL. com, Brooks told the group of students he met at Huntsville High: “They can ask any question they want.” And the News Courier reported last week that Brooks had toured the Lasertel facility in his district. “There are a lot of different factors that have caused me not to have any town halls, as some people interpret that phrase, and that’s where it’s open to anybody and everybody,” Brooks said, making air quotes around “town halls. ”  “On the one hand, town halls aren’t what they used to be. They used to be a forum in which citizens could come, you’d have a polite, courteous interchange of ideas, and I as a congressman would have a better idea as to what my constituents wanted, and constituents would have a better idea of what my belief system is and why I’m doing what I’m doing,” he continued.  “Nowadays with different elements from the Democratic Party, you’ve got the disrupters, you’ve got the Socialists, you’ve got the somewhat criminal element that’s engaged in criminal conduct at some of these types of events, you cannot have a town hall as those things used to be done.” According to AL. com, Brooks referenced four incidents of injury or property damage which had discouraged him from holding a town hall. Three of them did not occur at town hall events. Aside from protests against Milo Yiannopoulos at UC Berkeley and the burning of a limousine during the presidential inauguration, Brooks cited a boisterous exchange in Rep. Dana Rohrabacher’s ( ) Huntington Beach office, though accounts of what happened there differ wildly. Brooks also cited an incident of tire slashing outside Rep. Tom McClintock’s ( ) town hall last week. “I still have, quote unquote, ‘town halls,’ but they’re in a different kind of setting where we can still have a polite and courteous exchange of information,” he said. “Now, on the other hand, I’m still meeting with any constituent that wants to meet with me, but it’s not in front of a TV camera, where people tend to showboat. ”",

Buzzfeed News,Q1ZCaroline O'Donovan,Q1Z Nextdoor Rolls Out Product Fix It Hopes Will Stem Racial Profiling,"Q1Z’For example, try to post about your car windows being smashed, and you’ll be prompted with this message:’ ’Try to describe someone with just a racial characteristic, and you’ll see this prompt, asking you to be more descriptive:’] Nextdoor, a   social network for neighbors that has more than 10 million registered users, is rolling out a new tool today that the company says has reduced incidents of racial profiling on its network by 75% during tests. In recent years, so many people have used Nextdoor to report things like black men driving cars or hispanic women knocking on doors as suspicious or even criminal that the site has become known as a hub for racial profiling. The new tool, an algorithmic form for reporting crime and safety issues, has been in beta for an   portion of Nextdoor’s 108, 000 neighborhood groups since May. This feature, which automatically identifies racially coded terms and prevents users from posting without supplemental descriptors, goes live for all users today. “The impact of being racially profiled in general is terrible,” CEO Nirav Tolia told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday. “It runs counter to the mission of Nextdoor. It’s something we feel morally obligated to take seriously. ” Racial profiling became an issue for Nextdoor in 2015, when a number of news outlets reported on the frequency of posts about crime or suspicious behavior that mentioned an individual’s race, but little or nothing related to actual criminal activity. In many cases, these posts would refer to people of color doing things such as talking on the phone or walking a dog. Tolia said it wasn’t the bad press, but the work of civic groups in Oakland that brought the issue to his attention. Nextdoor touts its collaborations with police departments, city governments, and other public agencies. Last fall, Oakland Vice Mayor Annie Campbell Washington encouraged Oakland city departments to stop using the app to communicate with citizens until Nextdoor addressed the issue of racial profiling. By October, Tolia’s team was holding working groups with advocacy groups and city officials, and together they came up with a solution. The idea, which Tolia credits to members of a group called Neighbors for Racial Justice, was to change the way crime and safety issues are reported on Nextdoor. Instead of a blank text box and subject line, it was suggested that Nextdoor design a form that more closely resembles a police report or 911 dispatcher questionnaire. By explicitly requesting details about height, clothing, and age, they would discourage people filing reports from focusing exclusively on the race or ethnicity of the subject. Nextdoor features a wide variety of post categories  —   Classifieds, Events, etc.  —   but it’s the Crime and Safety section where people tend to focus on race to the exclusion of other salient details. As of today, Nextdoor neighbors posting a “crime” or “suspicious behavior” to the site will be warned against allowing an individual’s race to color their interpretation of events. And if their post focuses too much on the race or ethnicity of the subject, they’ll be prevented from publishing it. “When race is invoked, we create a higher bar,” Tolia explained. Nextdoor claims this new   system has, so far, reduced instances of racial profiling by 75%. It’s also decreased considerably the number of notes about crime and safety. During testing, the number of crime and safety issue reports abandoned before being published rose by 50%. “It’s a fairly significant dropoff,” said Tolia, “but we believe that, for Nextdoor, quality is more important than quantity. ” Vice Mayor Washington said she’s “thrilled” with the results Nextdoor has achieved. “I don’t think a lot of technology companies would have taken the steps they did, and made significant changes to their platform,” she said. When tech companies come under fire for failing to take race issues seriously  —   Snapchat, Twitter, and Airbnb are examples  —   critics often assert that, were minorities better represented on the staffs of those companies, the same mistakes might not have been made. But Tolia, who himself identifies as a person of color, said that while he’s working actively to diversify Nextdoor’s staff, when it comes to racial profiling, “we believe we get the best information from our members, and in this case, our advisers. ” But not all of Nextdoor’s advisers on the racial profiling project are satisfied with how the process turned out. Two founding members of Neighbors for Racial Justice, Audrey Williams and Shikira Porter, said Nextdoor left them out of the development process after a flurry of early interest. Porter told BuzzFeed News that she continues to see instances of racial profiling in her Nextdoor neighborhood despite the rollout of the form. Nextdoor confirmed that the company has not met with Neighbors for Racial Justice since the test pilot began in April, but said it was made aware of only two instances of racial profiling that had slipped through its algorithms in the last few months. “We’ve been doing the work of consultants for them, and they’ve been taking it as free,   volunteer advice from the community,”said Williams, who works in digital marketing. “And we’ve been happy to give it, because it makes our lives better. But over time, it began to feel a bit like exploitation. ” Nextdoor will hold a conference call for local stakeholders on Wednesday, but neither Williams nor Porter will be able to attend. Porter said it “didn’t feel right” to have Neighbors for Racial Justice attached to a project they felt the organization hadn’t been given a chance to sign off on. “We appreciate working with [Neighbors for Racial Justice] to create these improvements,” said Tolia in a   email. “We are encouraged by the progress, but know there is still more work to do. ” However, it’s clear that the contributions of Neighbors for Racial Justice and other local organizations to Nextdoor’s efforts were integral to the design and execution of the final product. Some of the copy Nextdoor ended up using in the form  —   such as, “Ask yourself, ‘Is what I saw actually suspicious, if I take race or ethnicity out of the question? ’”  —   came at the suggestion of Neighbors for Racial Justice. The new racial profiling form isn’t the only change Nextdoor has made in service of tempering racial profiling on its platform. Last November, the company introduced a checkbox that allows users to flag posts for racial profiling. More recently, it’s trained the group of   customer service representatives that reviews such posts in conflict resolution and “cultural humility” with an eye towards helping users understand why their posts were flagged, and how racial profiling negatively impacts whole communities. It’s unusual for a tech company to take such an active role in policing its users, or to make an investment in educating them about social and cultural issues. In addition to relying on community members, Nextdoor also hired consultants to help, among other things, define what racial profiling outside of a police setting even is. Debo Adegbile, a civil rights attorney with the NAACP who was nominated for US assistant attorney general by President Obama, and Grande Lum, a race relations expert with the Department of Justice, both worked as advisers to Nextdoor. Because the new form makes it less likely that users will post to Nextdoor, Tolia said there’s a “business cost to doing this. ” But given the way Airbnb, Twitter, and other tech companies have struggled with issues of race in recent months, it’s easy to see Tolia’s decision to meet the racial profiling problem   not just as morality, but also as good business sense. “Let’s not be fooled,” said Audrey Williams of Neighbors for Racial Justice. “It’s a win for us, and it’s a win for them. ”  ",Q1Z2016-09-01Z1Q
Buzzfeed News,Q1ZJina Moore,Q1Z German Officials Urge Caution About Perpetrators Of New Year’s Eve Assaults,"Q1Z Germany’s justice minister today condemned assaults and robberies that took place on New Year’s eve in Cologne, a cultural capital along the Rhine River in western Germany, promising to pursue the perpetrators  —   and insisting that rumors about the perpetrators’ alleged status as refugees won’t impact the investigation. Ninety criminal complaints have been filed so far by witnesses or victims who described a group of   men surrounding victims, according to Agence France Press, which cited local police. The complaints allege robbery, groping and in one case, at least, rape, according to the BBC. A Cologne newspaper and the BBC both reported that the perpetrators numbered an estimated 1, 000 men, and said the city’s police described the appearance of the men involved in the attack as “Arab or north African” origin, prompting speculation that the perpetrators may be refugees. But the local police stressed that the perpetrators were not, in fact, refugees, according to a local paper. “This is not about where someone is from but what they did,” Heiko Mass, the German justice minister, said at a press conference. “Making an issue out of it, lumping it together with the refugee issue, is nothing but exploitation. Now is the time to determine the facts and then decide on the necessary consequences. ” Mass called the assault “a wholly new dimension of organized crime. ” More than 950, 000 refugees, many from Iraq and Syria, arrived in Germany in 2015. “It would be disastrous if we allowed these [criminals] to poison the climate against refugees and other foreigners,” Aydan Özoguz, Germany’s minister for immigration and integration, told the Spiegel Online, Germany’s leading news magazine. “[T]his must not lead to refugees of whatever origin, who are seeking our protection from persecution, being placed under general suspicion,” Thomas de Maiziere, the ministry of interior, said.

Buzzfeed News,Q1ZJim Dalrymple II,Q1Z Murder Charge Dropped Against Sister Who Drove Twin Off Cliff In Hawaii,"Q1Z But on Wednesday  —   in a twist that even her own defense attorney had not anticipated  —   a judge threw out the case. District Court Judge Blaine Kobayashi ruled that prosecutors did not present enough evidence to support a   murder charge, the Associated Press reported. Alexandria’s attorney, Todd Eddins, said the day before that he expected the hearing to move smoothly to the next phase of the case, an arraignment, given the low bar prosecutors have to meet when presenting evidence that it should go forward.  Prosecutors declined to comment on the case Wednesday to BuzzFeed News and Eddins did not immediately return requests for comment. The murder charge was filed Monday and was the culmination of a bizarre case that began when the Duval sisters careened over a   cliff in a Ford Explorer. Moments before the crash, a group of Boy Scouts saw the    women arguing inside the vehicle. The car then quickly accelerated and smashed through a stone wall before plunging into the volcanic rock below. According to court documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News, Alexandria initially declined to give her full name after the crash. A review of her SUV’s airbag data also reportedly indicated that she didn’t apply the brakes before the vehicle went over the cliff.  “There was hard acceleration and a hard left steering input, which was consistent with the roadway evidence,” the documents said. Prosecutors also argued that in the days after the crash, Alexandria tried to leave Hawaii. She missed her initial flight and was arrested Friday, the same day she was scheduled to catch another plane. Failing to present sufficient evidence could end the case, or it could send prosecutors scrambling to find more information to bolster their argument. And after Wednesday’s ruling, prosecutors indicated they planned to move forward. “We will have to see what other evidence we can find by furthering the investigation,” Maui prosecuting attorney John Kim told the AP.

Ted Cruz. However, Tuesday’s primary results  —   and in particular John Kasich’s win in Ohio  —   increased the odds that no candidate will amass 1, 237 delegates before the GOP convention in July.  If that happens, the candidates will have to battle for the nomination at the convention. That scenario also could theoretically open the door for an entirely different candidate to swoop in and win the nomination. Asked later on Wednesday if he believed riots were possible at the convention, Ben Carson, who endorsed Trump after ending his own presidential bid, told CNN he believed a snub wouldn’t go over well. “There’s no question there would be a lot of turmoil,” Carson replied. The incidents have unfolded against the backdrop of heavy criticism from Republican Party leader, such as Mitt Romney, who would love to see someone else take the nomination.

National Review,Q1ZAlexandra DeSanctis,Q1ZHuman Rights Watch’s Alarmist Stance toward Trump,"Q1ZHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has apparently decided that incoming president Donald J. Trump is a threat to American civil liberties. In a summary of its 2017 world report released last week, the organization berates Trump for “float[ing] proposals that would harm millions of people, including plans to engage in massive deportations of immigrants, to curtail women’s rights and media freedoms, and to use torture” during his presidential campaign. In its full report, HRW argues that the policies Trump embraced on the stump “would cause tremendous harm to vulnerable communities, contravene the United States’ core human rights obligations, or both. ” The logic behind HRW’s warnings is flimsy. The U. S. the group suggests, is a potential abuser of basic human rights because under Trump the federal government might . . . enact a conservative rather than progressive model of health care. As evidence, the group notes Trump’s promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and “nominate ‘ ’ Supreme Court justices who would ‘automatically overturn Roe v. Wade, which would allow individual states to criminalize abortion. ” In the report’s estimation, it seems, repealing Obamacare and protecting unborn life amounts to the abuse of human rights. It might be easier to take HRW seriously if the group had a better track record of critiquing actual   abuses. Specifically, the group would do well to cease ignoring the ongoing terrorist attacks against Israel, and to refrain from blaming the country for enforcing “severe and discriminatory restrictions on Palestinians’ human rights. ” Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, and yet HRW considers it to be a violator of human rights and blames it, in large part, for the ongoing conflict with Palestine. HRW’s unmistakable bias against Israel and clear preference for aggressively   policies are just two examples of its skewed perspective on what constitutes a human right. Trump’s rhetoric and policy proposals were just that: rhetoric and proposals. He hasn’t yet taken office, and we have little idea what kind of president he’ll be. For now, it’s hard to take seriously claims that the freedom as we know it is in danger from a group with such a perverted view of the world.,",Q1Z2017-01-17Z1Q
National Review,Q1ZJonah Goldberg,Q1ZWho Are the Real Deniers of Science?,"Q1ZWhy do liberals hate science? The Left has long claimed that it has something of a monopoly on scientific expertise. For instance, long before Al Gore started making millions by claiming that anyone who disagreed with his apocalyptic prophecies was “” there were the “scientific socialists. ” “Social engineer” is now rightly seen as a term of scorn and derision, but it was once a label that progressive eggheads eagerly accepted.  Put aside the fact that there is no such thing as settled science. Scientists are constantly questioning their understanding of things that is what science does. All the great scientists of history are justly famous for overturning the assumptions of their fields. The real problem is that in politics, invocations of science are very often marketing techniques masquerading as appeals to irrefutable authority. In an increasingly secular society, having science on your side is better than having God on your side  —   at least in an argument. RELATED: The Assault on Science, For example, even if the existence of global warming is “settled,” the policies for how to best respond to it are not. But in the political debates about climate change, activists say that their climatological claims are irrefutable and so are their preferred remedies.  If climate change is the threat they claim, I’d rather spend billions on geoengineering to fix it than trillions on impoverishing economic policies that at best slightly delay it. It doesn’t matter I’m the Luddite buffoon for thinking ethanol subsidies and windmills are boondoggles.  Even more outrageous: If you dispute, say, the necessity of spending billions on windmills or on killing the coal industry, you are not merely wrong on climate change, you are “ . ” Intellectually, this is a monument of asininity so wide and tall, even the mind’s eye cannot glimpse its horizon or peak. RELATED: On Climate, Science and Politics Are Diverging, For starters, why are liberalism’s pet issues the lodestars of what constitutes scientific fact? Medical science informs us fetuses are human beings. The liberal response? “Who cares?” Genetically modified foods are safe, sayeth the scientists. “Shut up,” reply the liberal activists. IQ is partly heritable, the neuroscientists tell us. “Shut up, bigot,” the liberals shriek.

Jackson’s travails in a Vermont high school. “There were practical issues,” Anemona Hartocollis writes. “When he had his period, he wondered if he should revert to the girls’ bathroom, because there was no place to throw away his used tampons. ” RELATED: Making Sense of Transgenderism, Now, one can have sympathy for the transgendered  —   I certainly do  —   while simultaneously holding to the scientific fact that boys do not menstruate. This is a fact far more settled than the very best climate science. Perhaps it’s rude to say so, but facts do not cease to be facts simply because they offend. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio is pushing to fine businesses that do not address customers by their “preferred name, pronoun and title (e. g. Ms. .) regardless of the individual’s sex assigned at birth, anatomy, gender, medical history, appearance, or the sex indicated on the individual’s identification. ” The NYC Commission on Human Rights can penalize offenders up to $250, 000.

National Review,Q1ZKevin D. Williamson,Q1ZGeneral Washington’s Standard,"Q1Z‘Does not, then, the Almighty clearly impress an awe of the persons and authority of Kings upon the minds of their subjects, hereby proving Government of Divine origin?” So asked the Reverend J. R. Walsh in a pamphlet printed in 1829. “For, otherwise, by what principle could any one mortal command subjection from so many millions of fellow creatures?” That was a question very much upon the mind of King George IV, whose coronation provided the inspiration for the Reverend Walsh’s essay: That king’s father, George III, had been treated with a notable lack of awe by his American subjects, who gave him the shoe and set up their own republic, without any king at all. This experiment in awelessness, all the smart people of the late 18th century assured one another, was doomed to failure: Awelessness was next to lawlessness, they believed, and a people without a king to tell them how to behave or a king’s church to tell them why to behave were doomed to anarchy. Awe was very much on the minds of those early republicans. George Washington, whose name appears frequently in sentences containing the word “awe,” wrote that one of the purposes of our northern fortifications was to “awe the Indians. ” Thomas Paine, who had no great awe of the state, wrote of the constitutional right to keep and bear arms: “Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property. ” You’ll find a man’s heart where you find his awe: Walter Bagehot, founder of (that other) National Review and later editor of The Economist, lived to learn: “A schoolmaster should have an atmosphere of awe,” he wrote, “and walk wonderingly, as if he was amazed at being himself. ” Edmund Burke believed that even when addressing the defects of the state, we should treat it “with pious awe and trembling solicitude,” hence his hesitancy about the American Revolution and his detestation of the French one. The libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard would later argue the opposite, that failed revolutions are valuable to the extent that they “decrease the awe in which the constituted authority is held by the populace, and in that way will increase the chance of a later revolt against tyranny. ” The American Founders did not contemplate a world without awe of government, but they did intuit that a free,   democratic republic could get by with a good deal less of it. George Washington famously rejected an offer to make him king and thought that calling the president “Your Excellency” might be a bit much, too. We hear a great deal now about the “dignity of the office” and the need to have “respect for the presidency,” if not for the president himself, but nobody ever really says why. Why should we be awed at the chief bureaucrat of the federal administrative apparatus? Why should we hold in awe our employee? “Only I can fix” is Donald Trump’s illiterate shorthand for the idea that presidents are, like kings, products of divine election. George Washington never said anything like that he didn’t need to convince anybody that he was the man for the job, and he knew that the job was governing, not ruling. Share article on FacebookshareTweet There is something in us, something ugly and atavistic, that loves a king. Some unhappy people  —   and they are legion  —   long for a strong man before whom they can abase themselves, and thereby be relieved of the stress and terror of being responsible for their own lives. Unhappy with the state of your personal finances? Let the Great Father take care of it for you. Burke would have recognized what was going on right now in American politics. He argued that the American colonists had legitimate grievances but that those were married to a “dangerous spirit of disquisition, not in the coolness of philosophic inquiry, but inflamed with all the passions of a haughty, resentful people, who thought themselves deeply injured, and that they were contending for everything that was valuable in the world. ” And they didn’t even have cable news. It is pleasing and strange that on this Independence Day weekend we Americans are thinking in a special way about our British cousins, who, all these years after their damned stupid tea taxes and quartering troops in our houses, have gotten around to declaring their own independence, not from the Crown (which is now only a kind of Easter bonnet) but from the European Union, which began as a trading bloc and metastasized into another version of the cracked dream of a unitary European state, this one headquartered in Brussels rather than in Paris or Berlin. The European Union has all the usual trappings of awe: a banner, an anthem (from Beethoven’s Ninth) titles, etc. The great political genius of Nigel Farage and his hectoring, insulting EU speeches was his simple refusal to be awed by the European authorities. Perhaps the French, who were on the right side of the American Revolution, will join in next year, and remember who it was they sent us a statue of. We’ve done pretty well without an overabundance of awe: saved the world from   Germans  —   twice  —   and then went to the moon just to show that we could. Some Rotarians a few years back got together for lunch and decided that what they should do with their spare time is wipe out polio: They’re pretty close. We still have too much awe of the state for my taste, but nobody’s perfect. When he was named president of the Constitutional Convention, George Washington didn’t set his sights on inspiring awe or on any exercise in political and philosophical grandiosity intended to “command subjection,” in the Reverend Walsh’s words, but instead suggested a much more modest target: “Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair. ” Good advice then.

National Review,Q1ZDaniel Ruddy,Q1ZTrump Isn’t Teddy,"Q1ZRough in his manners he might occasionally be, but Donald Trump is nothing like the original Rough Rider, despite the wishful thinking of some commenters recently. At first glance, Theodore Roosevelt and Trump seem comparable because of TR’s 1912 presidential campaign, which, like Trump’s run for the White House this year, was a political insurgency against the Republican party’s “establishment. ” A brash New Yorker with an extraordinary talent for   that makes one think of Trump, TR also tapped into the public’s anger at    declaring war on an “invisible government” of special interests. But while it’s true that both men can accurately be described as populists and nationalists, a gigantic gulf separates them beyond these labels. Theodore Roosevelt was a brilliant intellectual. He entered the White House in 1901 as arguably the most prepared man ever to assume the presidency his understanding of public affairs was as deep as a bottomless trench. His knowledge came from two decades of voracious reading (he devoured a book a day) incessant writing (he authored 20 books) and bruising political combat at all levels of government (when he coined the phrase “man in the arena,” he was describing himself). In contrast, Trump has spent his life accumulating personal wealth and has no record of public service to the nation. Measured against TR, the ultimate policy wonk and   Trump stands out as a Lilliputian opportunist, woefully shallow and ignorant. On a personal level, Roosevelt  —   a straitlaced Victorian moralist  —   would probably despise Trump. Entirely faithful to his own wife, he would blanch at Trump’s infidelity and multiple divorces, and see their celebration in the tabloid press as a sign of national degradation. TR was an “old money” Knickerbocker aristocrat with simple tastes, and Trump’s gaudy displays of wealth would strike him as the boorish conduct of a cad. In TR’s view, cowboys, poets, historians, explorers, soldiers, and hunters were better company than millionaires he would rather go camping in Yosemite National Park with his friend the naturalist John Muir than spend a weekend drinking champagne at    with the snobs of Palm Beach.   In recent years, libertarian critics have attacked Theodore Roosevelt as a sinister “progressive” and “liberal fascist”   on ripping up the Constitution in order to create a “big government” despotism. This is a grotesque distortion of the truth. Unlike Trump, TR was a conservative with a long track record of aggressively fighting against radical leftists. While Trump has a long history of providing financial support to Jimmy Carter, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and other “progressives,” TR never in his life gave money to or supported a Democrat, not even a conservative Democrat such as Grover Cleveland, a man he admired.

While Donald Trump is running for president on a platform that includes proposals TR would undoubtedly support (such as sealing the border with Mexico) it’s absurd to imagine that our Rough Rider president would welcome a Trump presidency. Of all the values that American conservatives hold dear, Theodore Roosevelt never lost sight of the most important one: the safety of the state created by George Washington and saved by Abraham Lincoln. When utopians of his day floated crazy policy proposals that could never be implemented, TR famously condemned them as the dreams of the “lunatic fringe. ” Sensible reform movements led by reliable statesmen were his preferred route to change. William Randolph Hearst was an affront to this praiseworthy approach to governing the nation, and so is Donald Trump.,",Q1Z2016-08-29Z1Q
National Review,Q1ZMichael J. New,Q1ZTeen Contraception Programs Are Counterproductive,"Q1ZThe   movement receives a significant amount of criticism from pundits and commentators for not being more supportive of contraception and   programs. Most   respond by saying that any gains in contraception use will likely be offset by increases in sexual activity. This will actually result in both more unintended pregnancies and more abortions. 	A strong body of empirical evidence bolsters these arguments. For instance, last week the Journal of Health Economics published a study by British academics David Paton and Liam Wright. It found that recent budget cuts in Great Britain’s   program were correlated with statistically significant reductions in both the   rate and the teen abortion rate. 	During this time, local governments were required to use Teen Pregnancy Strategy grants to fund   and contraception programs. However, during the 2008 economic downturn, this requirement was removed  —   and then these grants were ended altogether during the 2010 —  2011 fiscal year. Afterward,   projects were funded through a general grant from the central government. Spending on   programs fell sharply, and teens’ pregnancy and abortion rates each fell by over 40 percent between 2008 and 2014. 	More importantly, these policy changes gave local governments considerably more freedom about how much money to spend on   and contraception programs. Because of the economic slowdown, most localities decided to enact spending reductions, but there was considerable variation regarding the timing and magnitude of these cuts. Paton and Wright nicely use this variation to analyze how spending on contraception and   programs affect pregnancy and abortion rates among teens at the local level. 	This study adds to an impressive body of research showing that programs to encourage contraception among teenagers are ineffective at best or counterproductive at worst. For instance, last year two Notre Dame economists found that 1990s   programs in U. S. high schools actually increased the teen fertility rate. A 2011 University of Michigan study found that significant increases in the price of oral contraceptives at campus health centers failed to have a significant impact on   rates. 	That said, even though this article has interesting findings and appeared in a top academic journal, it has received extremely little   coverage. So far, it has received some coverage from the London Times, the UK Daily Mail, and some conservative and Christian outlets here in the United States. Once again, the mainstream media eagerly touts any research that purportedly shows the   benefits of contraception programs, while scholarly criticism of such programs is ignored.

New York Post,Q1ZMarc Berman,Q1ZPorzingis was dropping weight fast — but found breakfast cure,"Q1ZCHARLOTTE, N. C.  —   Kristaps Porzingis realized he would shrink to nothing if he didn’t take the Knicks’ new dietitian’s advice and inhale a   breakfast. The   Knicks    rookie added 11 pounds from the end of July’s summer league to the start of training camp, but Porzingis started to gradually drop weight as the regular season rolled on and his minutes increased. After going from 227 to 238 pounds over the summer, Porzingis dropped to 233 by December. “Now I’m maintaining it,’’ Porzingis told The Post on Saturday. “I lost a little bit at the beginning of the season. It was hard to maintain that, but I’ve been staying at the same weight and I got to maintain this weight for sure. Once the season is over, I’ll try to get up to 245 pounds for next season. ’’ Knicks coach Derek Fisher has cited subtle changes in the Knicks training staff in aiding the team’s return to health this season after an   wreck that was  . One indicator is Porzingis playing in all 46 games, a surprise that is a credit to a medical staff led by Dr. Lisa Callahan. In part, Callahan brought in new dietitian Erika Whitman, who advised Porzingis to go full bore at breakfast as his weight declined, and to go to bed earlier. “I didn’t pay as much attention in the beginning of the season to breakfast,’’ Porzingis said. “I wanted to get to the gym. I’d eat something quick and go to work out. So now I’m getting up one hour, 1½ hours earlier and having a big breakfast so I have energy for the whole day. I’m really focusing on breakfast. ’’ Porzingis’ breakfast fare isn’t anything outlandish  —   just large portions. It helps that his parents have lived with their    son most of his rookie season in White Plains, and his mother, Ingrida, is a noted former hoopster and cook. His parents are staying until March. “A lot of cottage cheese with fruit, then eggs, ham, toast,’’ Porzingis said. “It’s kind of like an American breakfast, but Latvian style. It’s a big meal. I don’t think other people have big breakfasts like me. “[The Knicks] wanted me to have big breakfasts, but I’m really pushing myself to eat, even when I’m not hungry, so I can have a lot of energy for the day. ’’ The Knicks’ research before the draft showed Porzingis was susceptible to anemia  —   a condition in which the blood doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells. He contracted anemia as a    when he was in the minor division of the Spanish League, because he wasn’t eating right. Porzingis said he now carries iron pills on all road trips and hasn’t developed a pronounced case since. “I was so weak and sleepy because of the blood  —   I wasn’t eating enough,’’ Porzingis said. “Food changed from Lativan food to Spanish food and I couldn’t adjust. I was working out a lot, [had] a growing body and I got anemia. I have a few moments when my iron levels are low, I get sleepy and as soon as that happens, I take my iron pills and I’m fine. ’’ Porzingis, who clearly doesn’t want to miss a game, recently has played through a shoulder injury and a bruised foot, but some nights he’s a lot more lively than others. Porzingis revealed he played for a week with jammed index fingers on each hand that swelled up, but have since healed. Sources say his family is shocked he’s been able to battle through the ailments without missing a single game, keeping his Rookie of the Year candidacy alive. Porzingis has said he is trying to prove wrong the “durability police’’  —   the ones who suggested he would be   after missing three games in preseason. “I think [my family] knows I’m able to play though pain,’’ said Porzingis, who is averaging 14 points, 7. 8 rebounds and 2. 0 blocks while shooting 43 percent. “There’s a lot of stuff going on. That’s why I think they’re surprised. I want to [play all 82 games]. I’m really pushing myself through all the little injuries, little things I have going on. I want to stay strong mentally and play through it and have a complete season. I think physically this is my first year, I’m trying to figure out how to keep stay fresh for every game. ’’ The Knicks declined to make Whitman, the dietitian, available for comment. Even at 233 pounds, Fisher said Porzingis is fine for his rookie year. “He’s put on the amount of weight that’s good for where he is now,’’ Fisher said. “It’s always hard to hold or gain weight during the season because of the workload and how much energy you expend. It’s proportionate to your overall strength in terms of how much weight he can carry and strength ratio. He’s 20 years old, and as he physically matures, he’ll gain weight naturally.   …     We’ll try to do what we need to do this summer. ’’ Carmelo Anthony, who has missed four games and complained of a sore left knee Saturday, is no guarantee to play Tuesday against the Thunder at the Garden.",Q1Z2016-01-25Z1Q
New York Post,Q1ZJoel Sherman,"Q1ZThe radical, dice-rolling bent of Yankees’ new lineup","Q1ZSay you were tasked with writing a manual on how to build a Yankees champion based on the previous 27. Wouldn’t the very first chapter revolve around finding lefty power  —   and plenty of it? In 2017 and for the near future  —   unless your pinstriped watch is set to Bryce Harper time  —   the Yankees do not project to have an abundance of lefty power swinging for the short   porch. The best hope now and for the next few years is first baseman Greg Bird, and the Yankees are worried enough about the condition of his surgically repaired shoulder Hal Steinbrenner    —   a righty masher, if you are scoring at home. General manager Brian Cashman told me, “I think we have enough lefty hitting. ” And the Yankees could put six lefties into a lineup. But of that group, only Bird and perhaps Didi Gregorius project much power threat. “The power is not prevalent from the left side,” Cashman agreed. “That is the way the dominoes have shaken out. ” The Yankees GM said this has not been a philosophical alteration, though he acknowledged the swarm of defensive shifts has hurt the overall impact of a   lefty and made finding such types “not the priority it once was. ” Indeed, this was once the time of year the Yankees might sign a lefty homer threat such as Eric Chavez or Raul Ibanez. That kind of player was available in Pedro Alvarez, but the Yankees preferred Carter because they intend to have Matt Holliday as the everyday DH and wanted a righty   to Bird. The Yankees’ best regular lefty bats against righty pitching last year were Carlos Beltran and Brian McCann. Both were traded. Mark Teixeira retired. In the same time frame, the Yankees prioritized getting the best prospects possible when they dealt Aroldis Chapman and Andrew Miller. The key bats in return (Gleyber Torres and Clint Frazier) are both righties, as are Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez. So the future leans rightward, too. Sanchez actually had a 1. 093 OPS against righties in his starry cameo last year. Carter (. 803) and Holliday (. 776) had a better OPS against righties in 2016 than any current Yankees lefty hitter  —   and Holliday is known for strong power to  . Still, that underscores the weakness of the current Yankees lefty group. Gregorius hit 16 homers vs. righties, but had just a . 283   percentage.   Chase Headley provides little power from a power position at third, managing just a . 399 slugging percentage versus righties  —   remember that is with half his games at Yankee Stadium. The best returning lefties are Brett Gardner (. 745 OPS vs. righties) and Jacoby Ellsbury (. 744) who ranked 83rd and 84th in OPS vs. righties among those with at least 200 plate appearances. Aaron Hicks was brought in to be a force against lefty pitching and was atrocious (. 484 OPS) making his . 691 OPS against righties appealing only by comparison. This is why there is pressure on Bird. He had a . 915 OPS against righties in his impressive   debut in 2015 before missing all of 2016 after needing shoulder surgery. He did not hit well or play first base in the Arizona Fall League, which is why the Yankees felt they needed insurance with Carter. “We want [Bird] to emerge and approach the ceiling he possesses,” Cashman said. “We would bet on him. Two years ago, he was the best prospect in our system, and that included Gary Sanchez. He should work out. He has a great deal of ability. But if he doesn’t work out, we will find something that does. That is just the nature of the beast. ” In some ways, the Yankees have been ebbing toward this moment since the decision to let Robinson Cano go after the 2013 season and bring in Beltran, Ellsbury and McCann. Cano remains one of the majors’ best hitters and a destroyer of righty pitching. Only Ellsbury remains a Yankee. Meanwhile, the second baseman is Starlin Castro, a righty who hit 16 homers against righties with just a . 297   percentage. The Yankees probably would be better served with a   utility infielder rather than the righty Ronald Torreyes, but Cashman said it is not a point of emphasis to find one  —   prospect Tyler Wade ultimately might grow into that role. “There is no   philosophical change to get away from lefty power,” Cashman said. “It is how it has shaken out as we tried to upgrade each individual position. ” Still, the result is a Yankees team with as little predictable lefty power as any in recent memory. So, if you are setting that watch, Harper can be a free agent after the 2018 campaign.",Q1Z2017-02-09Z1Q
New York Post,Q1ZJohn Crudele,Q1ZA humiliating day awaits the Federal Reserve,"Q1ZFriday’s the day that the Federal Reserve will be embarrassed  —   yet again. The Commerce Department, at 8:30 a. m. Jan. 29, will announce how healthy the US economy was in the fourth quarter  —   and the answer is expected to be “not so good. ” In fact, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, the nation’s economy, or gross domestic product, grew at just a 0. 7 percent annual rate in the final three months of 2015. That’s not the official number  —   the official one will come on Friday from Commerce. The Atlanta Fed keeps running tabs on what the number should be, based on data already in circulation. They call it GDPNow and, so far, it has been pretty accurate. Some Wall Street economists have GDP forecasts that are even lower, much lower  —   like negative numbers lower. So why will the Fed be embarrassed? Because just last month, it raised interest rates despite the fact that it was quite clear that the economy was slowing. In fact, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model back in December wasn’t much higher than it is now. The Fed on Wednesday, following its January meeting, said it would keep interest rates right where they are. That is, no hike or cut. But already, it’s acknowledging that the US economy is slowing. Friday’s GDP should be a whack across the face since the rate hike was so recent. Stock prices fell sharply after the announcement, because the Fed said nice things about the labor market  —   something it will probably regret in less than a week  —   and because there seems to be more concern about inflation, which could prompt more rate hikes. Higher interest rates, of course, tend to slow down an economy. And to raise them when business conditions are noticeably weak  —   as they were at the end of 2015  —   is an obvious mistake. In fact, the Dow Jones industrial average is down 9. 1 percent since the day before the Dec. 16 Fed rate hike. Either the markets don’t like the hike, or the economy is cooling and profits are falling  —   taking stock prices with them  —   or both. I’ve already explained that the Fed felt that it needed to raise interest rates for a number of reasons that I can’t disagree with. For one thing, the    hike in December from the     rates gives the Fed an opportunity down the road to lower rates when the economy starts weakening. The second reason is that savers have been getting killed by the   rates, and I think that even the Fed now realizes that this unusual policy has been a disaster. But a couple of things have happened since the December hike. The first is that interest rates really didn’t go up. The   “discount rate” did  —   that’s the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans  —   and so, too, did the irrelevant prime rate. But interest rates in the open market have actually gone down because traders realize that the world economy is a mess and that borrowers will need to be incentivized to borrow through low rates. After Friday’s GDP number, there will be the usual defenders and detractors. The defenders, mostly Wall Street pros, will argue that economic growth slowed because (1) the weather in the US was warmer than normal and (2) China’s slowing growth hurt US companies. If the GDP on Friday comes in lighter than expected, you’ll start hearing two things. There will be howls first that the US is going into a recession and, second,  The calls for the Fed to “do something” will get louder if the stock market continues its abysmal performance  —   down 8. 5 percent this year. What can the Fed do? As I said above, it could take back the   rate hike it instituted in December, even if that will make Chair Janet Yellen and her policymaking committee look foolish. More likely, the members of the committee will start reassuring the markets that another rate hike won’t be happening until later than expected. Wall Street has been expecting another rate hike in March, but that time table now seems to have gone away. I’ve been saying that the next hike won’t be until summer, and that’s what the experts now seem to expect. Since I’ve been right, I’ll tell you what I think: The Fed will be given an opportunity to hike rates come June because it’ll get some misleadingly good economic numbers this spring  —   as it always does. Whether the Fed uses that opportunity to raise rates will depend a lot on how it thinks the financial markets will react. Right now, I’d guess there won’t be another hike this year  —   especially since a move like that might be awkward in a presidential election year. As exciting as this Friday will be for the financial market, next week will be even more so. On Feb. 5, the Labor Department will release its January employment report.  of 292, 000 jobs. I revealed in a previous column that almost all that growth came from seasonal adjustments and the real gains were 11, 000. Still, the 292, 000 is the only justification left for the Fed’s actions in December. A lousy employment report next week will put the Fed in a whole new kind of trouble. I won’t get into it now, but January jobs reports like the one coming next week are often disappointing because of some statistical quirks in the numbers. If this Friday’s GDP report elicits an “Oops” at the Fed, next Friday’s could result in a lot of “Oh, s —  t!”",Q1Z2016-01-28Z1Q

Guardian,Q1ZLucia Graves,Q1ZTrump said he’d be the president of all Americans. He’s already failing,"Q1ZIn the wee morning hours following the election, in the   ballroom of the Hilton Hotel, Donald Trump memorably proclaimed he would be the “president for all Americans”. It was a remarkable claim for a man who’d run a campaign mired in bigotry and xenophobia.  The following week President Obama declared he was certain Trump was “sincere” in his promise to be every American’s president, and over the weekend, in his final press conference of the year, the president was similarly conciliatory. World leaders have likewise made   gestures. Shortly after the election, the UN secretary general, Ban   predicted Trump would change his views on climate, and a key dignitary at a major UN climate meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, made a similar argument.  “We have for many months listened to the candidate Trump. Today we have to deal with the President Trump,” Morocco’s minister of the environment, Hakima El Haité, told me days after the election. “Those are two personalities. ” Already such optimism looks unwarranted. Since becoming   Trump has called for the mass deportation of immigrants. He’s also selected a cabinet that is mostly white, mostly male, and mostly business leaders  —   in other words, a cabinet that looks a whole lot like him. That’s not populism it’s cronyism. And it’s proliferating, even before inauguration day. After winning over   workers in middle America with promises to restore their slipping quality of life, for instance, he chose a CEO to head his labor department. His nominee has been outspoken in his opposition to minimum wage increases. And Trump wants a man who was once denied a federal judgeship over accusations of racism to head the justice department.  But perhaps the best barometer thus far of whether Trump will really be everyone’s president is his approach to climate change, which has emerged as an area of overwhelming concern among Americans, and which, in the decades ahead, will transform the fiscal and political landscape across the world. It may not rank near the top of people’s priorities list  —   it seldom does. But climate, and in particular renewable energy, has nevertheless emerged as a place where partisan rancor looks increasingly outdated.  Concern about climate change is already at an   high, according to Gallup’s most recent polling, with 64% of respondents say they worry “a great deal” or a “fair amount” about global warming. Nearly   of Americans now say humans are responsible, and while the percentage of people who think climate will pose a serious threat in their lifetime has ebbed slightly, that number is still well over half the population. But forget being the president for all Americans Trump is not even accurately representing his own party’s views. A majority of Republicans now believe the world’s climate is changing and that humans play some role in that, according to a recent survey by Republican pollsters. Mitt Romney, the party’s most recent nominee before Trump, has gone even further by saying we must do something about it. And at least some of the incredulity expressed over Trump’s recent cabinet picks has come from inside his own party  —   including from a former Republican administrator of the EPA. The faint hope engendered by an early meeting with Al Gore, and Trump’s remarks that he was keeping an “open mind” about international climate accords, was unceremoniously quashed last week as he proceeded to roll out what looks to be the most   administration in recent memory. And even before the cabinet announcements came out, Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley was proclaiming Trump will do away with a wind energy tax credit, “over my dead body”. Then there’s the fact that Trump didn’t even win the majority of votes in America. After campaigning on the idea that the American electoral system is rigged, back when he thought it was rigged in Hillary Clinton’s favor, he’s now espousing exactly the opposite: at a rally in Alabama on Saturday, he called the electoral college “genius”. What changed, of course, was who the system benefited. Now that it’s clear the outdated system benefits him, he’s all for it. The same is true of his claims Russian hackers influenced the outcome of the presidential election. Two years ago Trump said Russian hacking was a “big problem”. But now it looks to have benefited him, he calls claims Russia played any role in the election “ridiculous”. Foreign dignitaries like Haité shouldn’t hold their breath, particularly where international cooperation is concerned. Trump isn’t going to be the president of all Americans. He’s going to be the president for rich white men like him.",Q1Z2016-12-22Z1Q
Guardian,Q1ZNatalie Nougayrède,"Q1ZAs horror strikes again, all eyes are on how France reacts","Q1ZA night of national celebrations ends in  horror and tears. France is yet again in shock. Yet again in mourning. Bodies strewn in the road, families frantically searching for loved ones, crowds running wildly in the dark, a city in lockdown. In the immediate aftermath, political extremes actively trying to capitalise on the blind violence. After Charlie Hebdo and the Bataclan, now it is Nice’s waterfront. The attack happened on Bastille Day, as the anniversary of the French Revolution was being celebrated. That symbolism only added to the   pain of seeing photographs of some of the 84 dead and more than 200 wounded, including children. The attack happened hours after France’s annual military parade on the Champs Élysées, attended by the president, François Hollande, an event meant to demonstrate patriotic strength and unity. And it struck days after the Euro 2016 football tournament had finished without the dreaded news of another assault. There had barely been time to heave a sigh of relief. Now we have been plunged into yet more trauma. France feels devastated. The country is reeling from its third major terrorist attack in less than 18 months. Since 2015 the death toll has reached 231  —   and could still rise  —   to which should be added the seven people killed by Mohammed Merah in 2012, in  Montauban and Toulouse. How and why this could have been prevented will be much debated. Just days ago a French parliamentary investigation into the Paris attacks of November 2015 had concluded there had been a “global failure” of the country’s security and intelligence services. Yet, in a reflection of France’s patchy record of public accountability, no one in government seems to be considering resigning. Details about the assailant, a      who worked and lived in Nice, and his motives are still sketchy. But already Hollande has announced more airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against Islamic State, as well as the calling up of reservists and a   extension of France’s state of emergency  —   none of which is likely to address the roots of the problem. Terrorism has upended politics in France since 2015, and now that is about to get worse. It has put the nation on a war footing, heightened religious and ethnic tensions and fed growing partisan polarisation, which the National Front is set to benefit from during next year’s presidential election campaign. The fallout will be felt across Europe too, bringing a sinister boost to xenophobic narratives conflating immigrants and refugees with the threat of bombs and automatic rifles. Now, even without any link to Isis yet evident, jihadi terrorism has taken on a new face: the wild rampage of a truck on a touristy, festive Mediterranean shoreline. Nice is a cosmopolitan city, a huge social and ethnic mixture, a place where you find former “pieds noirs”  —   French colonials from Algeria,   pensioners from across France, communities of Muslim immigrants, rich Russians and tourists from all over the world. With past visitors from Chekhov to F Scott Fitzgerald, the city’s palaces and palm   squares have long been celebrated as part of France’s proud cultural heritage. A terror strike here is an attack not just at the diverse fabric of a society but at a vivid tourist industry and at an entire country’s sense of itself. There are two ways this can play out politically in France, and they may well be combined. If it turns out the attacker had connections with homegrown terrorist groups the country will be again confronted with burning questions about its difficulties in integrating second and   immigrants who feel alienated  —   not least because of France’s brand of secularism and its economy, where youth unemployment and discrimination are rife. But if the focus is on his Tunisian heritage, then there will be further examination of foreign fighter networks.  France’s plight points to how Europe has been unable to exert any influence on the Syrian civil war, where it has been sidelined from diplomacy while Russia and the US pursue an ambiguous rapprochement. This could strengthen Syria’s dictator, whose   policies of repression have provided a prime breeding ground for Isis. After Nice, expect France’s   leader, Marine Le Pen, to be on a roll. Her statements after the attack made that clear. With nine months to the presidential vote, French identity and security will be at the centre of all public discourse, and she will stand to gain. Beyond the terrible loss of families for ever torn apart and traumatised just because they wanted to watch fireworks on a warm summer evening, the wider result of this tragedy is that extremes, political and religious, will continue to feed off each other. Voices of reason and  moderation will be drowned out  —   “the bloody wedding of repression and terrorism” as Albert Camus once called it.",Q1Z2016-07-15Z1Q
Guardian,Q1ZPeter Beaumont,Q1ZUS signs deal to supply F-15 jets to Qatar after Trump terror claims,"Q1ZThe US has signed a $12bn deal to supply dozens of   jets to Qatar, despite recent   claims by President Donald Trump alleging Qatar’s “  funding” of terrorism. The signing of the deal on Wednesday is the latest twist in the highly contradictory US diplomacy over the crisis around Qatar  —   now in its second week  —   with the emirate targeted by a   embargo. Hailed by Qatar, the deal underlines the reigning confusion inside the Trump administration as it handles one of its first big foreign policy crises, which was in large part triggered by Trump.  Qatar is facing a severe economic and diplomatic boycott by Saudi Arabia and its regional allies, who cut ties last week accusing it of funding terrorist groups, a charge Doha denies. As well as severing economic and political ties, the four governments ordered Qataris out within 14 days and called home their own citizens. Bahrain and the UAE have also outlawed any expressions of sympathy for Qatar. Trump has repeatedly echoed the accusations against Qatar, despite attempts by his defence secretary, James Mattis, and secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, to offer a more neutral and nuanced position. He   on his accusations on Friday, saying: “The nation of Qatar has unfortunately been a funder of terrorism, and at a very high level,” adding “the time has come to call on Qatar to end its funding. ” Despite Trump’s remarks, Pentagon and state department officials have moved to reassure the emirate, home to the largest US airbase in the Middle East and the command headquarters for US military operations in the region. Tillerson said last week that the rift was hindering the campaign against Islamic State and Mattis on Wednesday signed the previously approved warplane deal with the Qatari defence minister, Khalid  . The Pentagon said the jets sale would increase security cooperation between the US and Qatar. It added Mattis and Attiyah had discussed current operations against Isis and the importance of   tensions in the Gulf. “This is of course proof that US institutions are with us but we have never doubted that,” a Qatari official in Doha said. “Our militaries are like brothers. America’s support for Qatar is   and not easily influenced by political changes. ” The state department provisionally approved the deal at the end of the Obama administration in language sharply at odds with Trump’s recent accusations. In a November memorandum, the state Department said the sale would “enhance the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a friendly country and strengthening our strategically important relationship”. The memorandum described Qatar as “an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Persian Gulf region”. A European diplomat in the Gulf said the timing of the deal appeared coincidental. “Presumably, the US could have delayed the deal if they’d wanted to, although I don’t think there’s a great connect between sales and foreign policy. ” ",Q1Z2017-06-15Z1Q

By comparison, Canada had its longest campaign season in recent history last year, and it lasted just 11 weeks,” she writes. “Countries across the globe have limited campaign seasons to as short as 6 weeks. With an organized system, a successful, informative, professional campaign could be run. ” Her suggestion for how we reform our electoral process  —   that we ask the DNC and RNC to reform the process  —   is less compelling. In a segment on Morning Joe on Wednesday, she threw out five days as the optimal amount of time (was she joking? ). And she’s previously floated the notion that all 50 states and the District of Columbia should hold their primaries on the same day, a move that would prove hugely advantageous to the richest candidates by   grassroots campaigns. The opening clip for Crow’s morning segment certainly felt ironic. In it, former British prime minister David Cameron is seen ribbing President Obama about the stupidly long length of American elections. “You always look on at the American elections in awe of the scale of the process and the length of the process,” Cameron says to Obama in a news conference from April of 2016, adding he marvels that anyone is left standing at the end of it. Obama joked back that term limits meant he too would get to sit back and “look in awe” at the process. In retrospect, of course, Cameron might have wanted something different. Two months later he’d be pushed from office over a voter referendum the result of which  —   Brexit  —   almost nobody saw coming. Crow moved on to how toxic media discourse has become. “This petition is simply an appeal from a midwestern mom, a single working mom who dives for the remote control before my kids can turn the TV on and see something I’m going to have to explain. ” Again the sentiment is relatable but perhaps the problem is less the length of the cycle than the fact our Republican nominee for president actively brags about “grabbing” women by the “pussy” a fact which, it’s worth noting, didn’t come out until more than 500 days into the cycle. What Crow deems the “start” of the election  —   Ted Cruz choosing to announce the beginning of his campaign  —   is not something the DNC or RNC can actually control. Nor is the fact that campaign reporters often start sourcing up to cover the next campaign the moment the current one ends. Party committees do set the timetable for primaries, but even there they are in a constant    with state governments, which battle to move up in the primary calendar so their voters get more attention. As for entreaties to focus more on policy, we may not have gotten as far into the weeds on the tax code or what we need to do to save the environment, but we have furthered the national conversation around racism, xenophobia and, particularly, sexual assault, and those are things that should not be written off as empty identity politics. Since audio leaked of Trump bragging about it on 7 October, a dozen different women have spoken about his alleged sexual misbehavior. That’s not something I want America’s kids watching either. It’s not something I’ve loved covering  —   it’s been emotionally and physically exhausting. But it’s more important that voters know who our next president actually is rather than collectively covering their ears. With all due respect, I don’t think Crow understands the value of what journalists have done this cycle. Muting the television won’t protect our kids from our reality. And reducing the amount of time we have to learn about the people running for the most powerful job in the world, particularly when so much of what comes out of their mouths is disinformation, won’t make it harder to fool the American public: it will make it infinitely easier.",Q1Z2016-10-26Z1Q
Guardian,Q1ZRobert Simonson,"Q1ZHow to make a caipirinha, the Brazilian cocktail that could unseat the margarita","Q1ZThe   cocktail in the United States is the margarita. But during the run of the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which continues until 21 August, it may be supplanted by another     classic: the caipirinha. You don’t have to dig too deeply into Brazilian drinking habits before you bump into the caipirinha. It’s the national cocktail and is made with Brazil’s most common and popular indigenous spirit: cachaça, a   distillate. (Don’t call it “Brazilian rum” unless you want to start an argument. The country lobbied hard to get to the American government to recognize the spirit as a distinct product native to Brazil.) The caipirinha isn’t too far removed from its   drinking buddies, the margarita and daiquiri. All share the tropical trinity of sugar, lime juice and spirit. In the caipirinha’s case, half of a lime, cut into wedges, is muddled with sugar at the bottom of a rocks glass and then topped with cachaça and ice. It’s a simple drink, even if it does require a little elbow grease to make. Americans first began to see the caipirinha pop up at bars in the 1990s, hot off the heels of the mojito craze, another equatorial drink that involves muddling  —   in the mojito’s case, mint. “A caipirinha is right on par with a mojito as a classic, refreshing, summertime drink,” said mixologist Ivy Mix, an owner of the Brooklyn bar Leyenda, which specializes in drinks made with Latin spirits.  The caipirinha remains the cocktail most closely associated with cachaça . However, cachaça’s fortunes in the States have changed significantly since the dawn of the new century.  “Before, most of the cachaça exported from Brazil used to be industrial cachaça,” said Thiago Carmosina,   of Yaguara Cachaça, and a   member of a   family. “It was  . Lately, you have a bunch of artisanal brands who have begun to export abroad. ”  Most white, unaged cachaças are made with a column still, which produces a clean but less complex spirit. Recently, they have had to share space on American liquor store shelves with cachaças made from an old fashioned pot still, which produce a more funky, flavorful spirit, and the aged versions of the spirit that are more commonly drunk in Brazil  —   often straight. According to Carmosina, cachaça can be aged in barrels made from any of twenty kinds of wood, many of them native to the country. “All of a sudden there was diversity in the category,” said Dragos Axinte of the Novo Fogo brand, which first introduced aged cachaça to the American public. “It shows the spirit has depth. ” Do different barrels really make a difference in the flavor? Mix, who carries four different versions of the Novo Fogo brand, thinks so: “It all tastes totally different. ”  The Tanager expression, for instance, which is aged in both oak and arariba (Brazilian zebrawood) barrels, “tastes like cinnamon nut crunch”. Novo Fogo also sells   cachaças, imitating the popular proprietary practice pioneered by the bourbon industry. Bars are able to sample and select a specific cask of liquid. Novo Fogo then bottles the barrel’s contents and ships it to the bar, which sells it exclusively.  In this brave new world of wide cachaça choice, the tried and true caipirinha can been seen as both a boon and a burden.  “I think it’s a positive to start with,” said Carmosina. “It’s a nice way to open doors so they explore the cachaça world. Then again, if they only know the caipirinha, they’re only going to drink that. In the long term, it hurts us. In the short term, it helps us a lot. ” You can get a caipirinha at Leyenda, but don’t expect to see it on the menu. “We don’t really make that many caipirinhas,” said Mix. “I like to make cachaça drinks that aren’t so pigeonholed. ” ½ lime, cut into quarters, Barspoon of sugar, 2 ounces unaged cachaça, Place lime wedges and sugar in a   rocks glass. Muddle gently. Add Cachaça and ice. Stir briefly. Garnish with lime wedge.",Q1Z2016-08-09Z1Q
NPR,Q1ZAlina Selyukh,"Q1ZPostelection, Overwhelmed Facebook Users Unfriend, Cut Back","Q1ZRachael Garrity posted a farewell message on Facebook. She told her ”friends”  —   that’s how she puts it in an email to NPR, in quotes  —   that she would delete her account. An email from her son followed: Are you OK? ”I am finding Facebook to have a negative impact on my continuing to keep a positive feeling regarding some of the people I have known longest and cherish most,” writes Garrity, who has worked in    marketing and publishing since the 1970s. Garrity was one of more than 150 people who have shared their stories with NPR, recapping how they are recalibrating their attitude toward social media after this year’s election. Donald Trump’s surprise victory ended an emotional   of a presidential race, which has left Facebook, Google and Twitter scrambling to rein in a proliferation of fake news and harassing behavior. ”What was really shocking to me was how many people who I consider to be smart were sharing things that were not so smart, definitely obviously fake but matched whatever viewpoint that they pushed or agreed with,” says Michael Lowder. He’s Garrity’s grandson  —   and he shared her story with NPR because, true to her word, she has quit Facebook, where NPR posted the  . As for himself, Lowder has no plans to abandon social media, and a few people wrote in to say they are actually doubling down, regretting not speaking out more before the election, or feeling freed to speak their minds now that Trump is   or finding support in   communities. But the vast majority of emails  —   some of them nearing 1, 000 words in length  —   read like testimonials to a therapist: I’m having a hard time focusing. I have questioned my friendships. I can’t stop scrolling. I’m exhausted. One email to NPR ended with: ”It was good to get that off my chest.” People are turning off TVs (one even canceled her cable  —   mass media are not off the hook, either) deleting social apps from their phones, rationing time spent on Facebook and Twitter, and shrinking their digital friend lists. Facebook is a source of news for a majority of American adults, but in the vitriol and propaganda of the 2016 election, its proverbial public square for many users has devolved into a     debate  —   or an omnipresent Speakers’ Corner. As Lowder says his father put it, opining on social media is the equivalent of shouting off a soapbox in the street: a declaration, rather than discussion. This view, of course, cuts against the way Facebook views itself. ”Friends and family come first” was said to be its guiding value in a shakeup of the news feed algorithm revealed in June. Susan Brubaker Knapp from Mooresville, N. C. writes: ”The day after the election, the hate and darkness got to be too much. I unfriended nearly everyone. Now I have three friends: my husband and children. . .. I do hold (Facebook) responsible for helping to spread disinformation that contributed to both the election results and the level of vitriol and hate in this country. I am building my own wall now.” A similar sentiment from Todd Neigum: ”(The election) simply turned me off of Facebook. I started by unfollowing people I’ve known for 40 years. Neighbors, friends, family doesn’t mean I have to wade through untold numbers of gloating, trashtalking, flamethrowing posts.” Much of the consternation does come from supporters of Hillary Clinton, who find themselves inundated and overwhelmed by news about a candidate they oppose. But then there are people like Tin Samuel, a tech consultant from Kansas City, Mo. who did vote for Trump. Back in 2015, Samuel set up a second profile, splitting his closest connections from more professional ones, theoretically carving out a space to comfortably express his opinion. It hasn’t worked out that way, he writes, as people who disagree with him ”lob insults” and he has found he’s censoring himself on both profiles: ”It’s not just strangers that are engaging in this kind of behavior. It’s people I’ve known for 20 years. . .. It’s one thing when you’re insulted by a stranger on an NPR or CNN newsfeed. It’s quite another when you’re being threatened by someone who knows where you live. . .. ”For the rest of the year at least, I’m going to stop talking about politics altogether online, and focus on the topics and things that I find more interesting. Technology, silly cat memes, Brazilian dance music, and food videos. You know, all that stuff the internet was always supposed to be about to begin with.” And actually, a few people have reported creating a dual presence on the platform, turning to a new profile void of political pages and opinionated friends or family. Writes health care worker Jackie Prack from Greenville, S. C.: ”The election was the last straw for me. In the days after, all I saw was hate. From both sides. . .. I decided that day to get rid of my original Facebook and create my ’new’ Facebook . .. full of running, bikes, breweries, cat videos, satire, art, music, hiking, food, and good people. . .. If the world is falling apart, my head is solidly in the sand right now . .. and it’s nice down here.” Rationing of social media time has been a common response, too. Greg Jeffers, a teacher from Rowlett, Texas, describes himself as a ”deeply religious” person and a social conservative  —   he voted for Evan McMullin, a former CIA officer who is a Mormon. Jeffers says before the election, he obsessively shared ”every article I was reading on Facebook” and getting into arguments with friends and friends of friends, who as conservatives supported Trump. Unlike many users struggling to burst or embrace ideological bubbles formed on Facebook, Jeffers faced a different challenge: ”Since (Trump) won, I realized I would have at least four more years of being ideologically separated from my tribe. I also realized that I had become a meaner, more cynical person. . .. ”I decided not to totally delete Facebook. It really is a good way to stay in touch with people. But, I did decide to have my wife change my password. And I decided that I would allow myself an hour a week (30 minutes on Saturday and 30 minutes on Tuesday or Wednesday) to peruse Facebook and stay caught up.” Jeffers writes that he’s thinking of shifting his time from Facebook arguments to something practical, spending time with his wife and daughters, his students, his church family. ”Maybe I can, through my church, teach ESL to refugees,” he writes. And then there’s Emily Prymula from Wadsworth, Ill. who says, in her rebound from social media overdose, she began researching how to run for local elected office: ”I can’t make a difference or change someone’s opinion through a Facebook discussion, but I can do so through being present in my community.” She describes herself as an independent, which she says turned her news feed into an ”ideological battleground”: ”Facebook felt like a summit on a frustrating,   illness, all of my friends doctors of their own dogma, trying to convince one another that their preferred course of treatment had less severe side effects and a better   outcome for the patient. . .. I turned off my notifications, and vowed to only post positive news about my life for my family and friends.” Monica Eskin makes an interesting observation: ”There is a reason that voting is anonymous: so it doesn’t destroy your ability to live with your neighbors. As their neighbor I know less about them than I do as their (Facebook) friend, and maybe that’s the way it is supposed to be with your neighbors and coworkers, etc.” But of course, many emails make the  : ”Let’s be honest, most political conversation happens on social media these days . .. for better or for worse,” writes Carmen Jenkins, who describes herself as a moderate,     Republican. ”If I want to have a voice in this conversation, I better engage,” she says. ”I better engage in a way that promotes dialogue rather than shutting it down with judgments and generalizations.” How effective Jenkins and others like her will be just might determine how social media shapes up (is it too soon to say this?) for the next election.",Q1Z2016-11-20Z1Q
NPR,Q1ZWynne Davis,"Q1ZA Year After The Paris Attacks, The Conversation Has Changed","Q1ZLast fall, I was an American college student in Paris, studying international security and terrorism. I knew when I chose Paris that it would be an excellent place to further my studies, but I did not expect to experience the subject  . Everyone I met in Paris felt safe there, whether they were other Americans or French. I had one friend who felt safer in Paris than she felt in Austin, Texas, where we attended the University of Texas. We all thought our discussions about terrorism were mostly theoretical and about events taking place somewhere else. But that changed in an instant, on Nov. 13, 2015. It began as a typical Friday evening in Paris. Cafes and bars bustled as people sat outside with friends. People made their way to concert halls. Tourists went up and down the Eiffel Tower to see the City of Lights all lit up. Then came the news of the multiple bombings and shootings across the city. I was just getting off the subway after my last class and walking into my flat in the city’s 8th arrondissement. The attacks took place only 20 minutes from my apartment, in an area so many of us had visited. At first, I didn’t think too much about a shooting. I had lived in the U. S. in Illinois and Texas, my entire life and shootings happen so often, it’s hard to keep track of them. But this was Paris, a place where the police were the only ones who were supposed to carry guns. I wasn’t the only one who felt this way. My friends from all over the world, including the French ones, felt secure. They said they didn’t believe they needed guns to protect themselves, even after an earlier attack in January 2015, when terrorists walked into the office of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical publication, and killed 12 people. Conversations about the widespread presence of guns in the U. S. often came up when I mentioned I was an exchange student from the University of Texas. Many students, from France and other countries, knew about the ”campus carry” debate in Texas and had questions as to why anyone would need a gun in a classroom. I tried to explain both sides of the debate. Still, they believed the police should be the only ones with guns. Sebastien Galbrun, who is French, is one of the students I met while I was studying in Paris at Sciences Po. He believed, and still believes, Paris is a safe city, though he did acknowledge the shooting at Charlie Hebdo, followed by November attacks, shook him up. ”You feel your country, your city, your own identity was being shot at,” Galbrun said. ”Your personal feeling, your identity  —   people want to do bad things to your identity. I was really shocked, really hurt.” Galbrun still doesn’t believe people should possess guns in their home. ”I think weapons are a means for the state to regulate,” he said. The attacks did change security in Paris. There were more bag checks when people entered buildings. People were more vigilant and wary of those who stepped onto the metro with bags. Police were more visible than before. My friends didn’t change their views on the private ownership of guns after the attacks, but the conversations were different. One friend, Everica Rivera, taught English in French schools. We knew each other from the University of Texas, where she studied the same topic I did. Following the attacks, she tried to find the meaning or possible symbolism behind the places the terrorists targeted. ”I expected them to blow up a metro station like they did later on in Brussels, or around the Eiffel Tower  —   you know, tourist areas,” Rivera said. ”But no, they only hit local places.” After the November attacks, I had friends tell me they were contemplating leaving France and going back home early, before the semester was over. Sciences Po and other universities arranged for students to take their finals from home if they wanted to leave. One of my friends from Ireland decided to take that option. Most of the people around me wanted to stay, as did I. And the city came together after the attack. Paris lived up to a motto: ”fluctuat nec mergitur,” or ”tossed but not sunk.” Though the city was shaken, people went on with their lives. Teachers made an effort to talk about the attacks and provide guidance. My French professor was one of them. During the class after the attacks, he told us one thing: You should not be afraid to be here and to live here. Paris is still safe. While security increased in Paris and other parts of the country, France was still vulnerable. The French were celebrating Bastille Day in July in Nice, where an attacker drove a truck into the crowd, killing more than 80 people. But I still believe my professor who said we shouldn’t be afraid to live in Paris. My friends reinforced this. They said they will never forget Nov. 13, 2015, but there’s still so much to live for. ”We were not going to be defined by these attacks,” Galbrun said. ”We were going to stay strong and stay together.” A year after the Paris attacks, some people are still wary about traveling to the city or to Europe in general. But that’s not me. I know I’ll be back in Paris, sooner rather than later. Wynne Davis is an intern at NPR in Washington.",Q1Z2016-11-14Z1Q
NPR,Q1ZBill Chappell,Q1ZExplorer Dies Just Short Of Goal: Crossing The Antarctic Unaided,"Q1ZHe traveled more than 900 miles across the Antarctic, attempting a solo trek that would also boost a British charity that aids wounded veterans. But explorer Henry Worsley was halted by exhaustion and dehydration that turned out to be fatal. Worsley, 55, had been attempting to complete the   solo and unassisted crossing of the Antarctic landmass, timing the venture to coincide with the centenary of Sir Ernest Shackleton’s 1915 attempt. But when treacherous conditions and deteriorating health confined Worsley to his tent at more than 9, 000 feet, he was forced to abandon the attempt, calling for an airlift. After spending 70 days alone in some of the harshest conditions our planet has to offer, he was taken to a hospital in Chile, where he was diagnosed with bacterial peritonitis. Today, his family announced his death. A Twitter feed that had been updating his progress shows Worsley had in recent days been facing whiteout conditions and soft snow  —   a ”hellish surface” that made it hard to ski (and pull a small sleigh). Worsley had been filing audio postcards from each day of his journey. In one of the last, he announced, ”My journey is at an end. I have run out of time and physical endurance  —   and the simple, sheer inability to slide one ski in front of the other to travel the distance required to reach my goal.” ”I spent 70 days all alone in a place I love,” he said, adding that the generosity of those who supported his charity efforts would help him cope with his disappointment of stopping short. Upon his return to civilization, Worsley said, ”The first thing I’ll do: get a hot cup of tea, perhaps with cake.” A married father of two, Worsley had previously completed two other Antarctic treks: one in   and another in  . Those trips commemorated South Pole expeditions by Shackleton, Capt. Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen. The Endeavour Fund, the charity Worsley was affiliated with, passes along a statement from Worsley’s wife, Joanna: ”It is with heartbroken sadness I let you know that my husband Henry Worsley has died following complete organ failure despite all efforts of ALE and medical staff at the Clinica Magallanes in Punta Arenas, Chile. ”Henry achieved his Shackleton Solo goals: of raising over £100, 000 for the Endeavour Fund, to help his wounded colleagues, and so nearly completing the first unsupported crossing of the Antarctic landmass. A crossing made, under exceptionally difficult weather conditions, to mark the 100th anniversary of Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Endurance expedition  —   his lifelong hero. ”On behalf of myself and family I wish to thank the many hundreds of you who have shown unfailing support to Henry throughout his courageous final challenge and great generosity to the Endeavour Fund. Donations now total over £106, 773.”",Q1Z2016-01-25Z1Q
NPR,Q1ZKatherine Hobson,"Q1ZPot And Pregnancy: No Harm Seen At Birth, But Many Questions Remain","Q1Z, Between 2 percent and 5 percent of women say they use marijuana while pregnant, according to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. And while harm to the fetus is certainly plausible since the drug crosses the placenta, the evidence has been spotty. Now a review and analysis of 31 previously published studies has found no independent connection between a mother’s pot use and adverse birth events. But the doctors say that doesn’t mean it’s OK to partake. Based on unadjusted data, the review found a link between marijuana use and both low birth weight and preterm delivery. But when the researchers adjusted the data to account for confounding factors including tobacco  —   which is often used alongside marijuana  —   there was no association, says Shayna Conner, an assistant professor in the division of maternal fetal medicine and ultrasound at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine and an author of the study. In other words, from the available evidence it seems that the risk surrounding birth is from tobacco use and other factors, not from the marijuana itself. Conner emphasizes that message is still clear: Don’t use pot when you’re pregnant. ”Any foreign substance that doesn’t directly benefit maternal or fetal health should be avoided,” she says. But the analysis suggests that public health dollars budgeted for preventing bad birth outcomes should be spent to discourage the things with more evidence of harm, such as tobacco or alcohol, she says. There are still plenty of reasons for women to be cautious about marijuana use. For one, the body of evidence on this topic is inconsistent. Different studies looked at different neonatal outcomes. And most of the studies relied at least in part on women to report their marijuana use. ”That may mean that patients who do smoke but don’t tell their provider may be misclassified,” says Conner. Moreover, this review, which was published Thursday in Obstetrics  Gynecology, focused only on adverse neonatal outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm delivery and stillbirth. It didn’t cover the   risk of neurodevelopmental problems such as cognitive difficulties or ADHD. A separate review of evidence published in December found that while the studies in humans on that topic are flawed, ”there is a concerning pattern of altered neurodevelopment with early, heavy maternal use of marijuana.” ”Any time there’s a substance that we’re not sure of the effects on the fetus or the mother during pregnancy, unless we know of a strong benefit to using the substance we’d advise not to use it,” says Torri Metz, an assistant professor of   medicine at the University of Colorado Denver, and an author of that December paper. It also found no solid evidence for the benefits of medical marijuana in pregnancy to prevent nausea. She and her   called for   prospective studies to better understand the impact of marijuana use on pregnancy and breastfeeding. And how should women who are trying to conceive or who aren’t using birth control think about pot? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention got a lot of flak earlier this year for recommending that women in those circumstances abstain from drinking alcohol altogether. Very few studies have looked at the time of marijuana exposure and connected that to outcomes. But Conner said many of the studies covered by the new review included women in the earliest part of their pregnancies, which might give some reassurance to women who are worried about pot use before they discovered they were pregnant. In Colorado, where both medical and recreational use of marijuana are legal, the Department of Public Health  Environment advises women not to use the drug during pregnancy. In fact, if the baby is tested at birth and is positive for THC, the law requires child protective services be notified. The question of how prenatal exposure to pot affects a baby will almost certainly become more pressing, with five states including California voting in November on whether to legalize recreational use.

NPR,Q1ZPhilip Ewing,"Q1ZThat ’Armada’ Heading To North Korea? Actually, It Sailed South","Q1ZThe ”armada” that President Trump said he was sending to deter North Korea still hasn’t arrived  —   and it has thousands more miles to cover if it actually does sail to the Korean Peninsula. The aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and its strike group actually sailed south after U. S. Pacific Command announced April 8 that it was canceling the ships’ planned visit to Australia and instead ordering them to ”sail north and report on station to the Western Pacific Ocean.” The Navy posted an official photograph dated April 15 that showed the Carl Vinson in an Indonesian strait thousands of miles south of North Korea. The carrier and its companions could still make their way back to the Korean Peninsula, which they last visited in March, but U. S. defense officials generally decline to describe the deployments of American military units before the fact. News organizations around the world, including NPR, covered the statements by Trump and other officials in Washington about the Carl Vinson’s deployment as though the ships were bearing down on North Korea. The narrative last week was that the U. S. and its allies in the western Pacific were gearing up for a showdown with strongman Kim Jong Un ahead of the anniversary of the birth of his grandfather, the late North Korean leader Kim Il Sung. ”We are sending an armada, very powerful,” Trump told Fox Business News, warning that Kim Jong Un ”is doing the wrong thing.” Other nations were said to be joining in. News reports said Japan was planning to deploy its own destroyers to form up with the Carl Vinson and its U. S. escorts, the destroyers USS Wayne E. Meyer and Michael Murphy and the cruiser USS Lake Champlain. That could still happen, but the potential flashpoint that many expected over the weekend has passed: North Korea attempted to fire a ballistic missile early Sunday, but it exploded very soon after launch. It did not conduct a nuclear weapons test or attempt an attack on South Korea or Japan, which might have prompted a military crisis. Defense News’   naval correspondent Christopher P. Cavas was first to report Monday about the Navy’s post that revealed the Carl Vinson nowhere near the Korean Peninsula. It isn’t clear yet whether the storyline about the Carl Vinson was the product of deliberate deception by the Navy, defense officials in Washington or the White House, or whether internal miscommunication within the government might have turned the snowball into the avalanche. But as part of its regular updates about the operations of the strike group after it sailed from Singapore, the Navy posted photos of ships and aircraft along with captions describing them as underway in ”the South China Sea.” The South China Sea technically extends south of Singapore and flows among the islands that make up Indonesia before it becomes the Java Sea. So although the Navy’s details might have been accurate, they never specified where in the South China Sea, or in which direction the ships were sailing.

Reuters,Q1ZAhmed Rasheed and Saif Hameed,Q1ZIraq searching for three U.S. citizens reportedly abducted,"Q1Z Security forces in Baghdad were hunting for three U. S. citizens who Iraqi lawmakers said on Monday had been kidnapped, which, if confirmed, would make them the first Americans abducted in the country since U. S. troops withdrew in 2011. Unknown gunmen seized the trio from a private apartment on Friday in the capital’s southeastern Dora district, said Mohammed   who sits on parliament’s security and defense panel. It was not immediately clear if their motives were political or criminal. Iskandar Witwit, deputy head of the same panel, gave a similar account citing senior security officials who said the civilians had been taken from the district’s Sihha residential complex. Two of the three also had Iraqi citizenship, he said.   Shi’ite Muslim militia fighters, seen as a bulwark in the fight against Islamic State militants, have a heavy presence in that part of the predominately Sunni district. The three men work for a small company that is doing maintenance work for the information technology division of General Dynamics Corp, under a larger contract with the U. S. Army, according to a source familiar with the matter.  The names of two of the men, which were first published by Fox News and other media outlets, are Wael   (whose name is also spelled, Wael  ) and Amro Mohammed, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The spelling of the first man’s name was not consistent in information provided by authorities, said the source.    The name of the third man was not immediately available. Mark Meudt, a spokesman for General Dynamics, referred all queries to the U. S. State Department. The State Department on Sunday had it was working with Iraqi authorities to locate Americans reported missing, without confirming they had been kidnapped. A State Department spokeswoman on Monday declined to provide any further comment, citing ”privacy considerations.”  Dora was a bastion of the insurgency against the 2003 U. S.  invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein and the site of intense sectarian bloodletting that peaked around  . Federal police now run most checkpoints there. The capital of Iraq, OPEC’s second biggest oil exporter, has seen a proliferation in recent years of   criminal gangs that carry out contract killings, kidnappings and extortion. Iraqi police set up extra checkpoints in Dora on Monday and sent out helicopter search parties. Two Iraqi army helicopters were seen hovering over the district, while police vehicles patrolled the streets, residents said. The Iraqi government has struggled to rein in the Shi’ite militias, many of which fought the U. S. military following the 2003 invasion and have previously been accused of killing and abducting American nationals. Iraq has seen a series of abductions of foreign nationals in recent months. At least 26 Qatari hunters kidnapped last month in the southern desert by unknown militants have not yet been found. In September, 18 Turks taken in Baghdad by an armed group that used a Shi’ite Muslim slogan were released following several weeks in detention.

Reuters,Q1ZEric Auchard and Tova Cohen,Q1ZMobileye says Tesla was ’pushing the envelope in terms of safety’,"Q1Z Mobileye ( ) broke ties with Tesla Motors ( ) because the Silicon Valley firm was “pushing the envelope in terms of safety” with the design of its Autopilot   system, Mobileye’s chairman said on Wednesday. ”It is not designed to cover all possible crash situations in a safe manner,” Amnon Shashua, who is also chief technology officer at the   maker of collision detection and driver assistance systems, told Reuters. “No matter how you spin it, (Autopilot) is not designed for that. It is a driver assistance system and not a driverless system,” he said in an interview.  The safety of Autopilot, which helps drivers stay in lanes and steer on highways, was thrust into the public spotlight after a fatal crash involving a Tesla Model S driver using the new technology in May. Tesla said in a blogpost after the accident that ”neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.” A Tesla spokeswoman said Wednesday the company had never described Autopilot as an autonomous technology or   car. ”Since the release of Autopilot, we’ve continuously educated customers on the use of the features, reminding them that they’re responsible to keep their hands on the wheel and remain alert and present when using Autopilot,” the spokeswoman said. ”Drivers must be prepared to take control at all times.” However, drivers using Autopilot were able to take their hands off the wheel at highway speeds for several minutes at a time. YouTube videos proliferated soon after the system’s launch last fall showing Tesla drivers driving   prompting Musk to express concern about drivers doing ”crazy things.” The company in January said it was modifying the system.  AN UNUSUALLY PUBLIC RIFT On Sunday, Tesla said it would update Autopilot to make it more difficult for drivers to ignore warnings to keep hands on the wheel and other changes that Musk said would probably have prevented the fatality in May. Musk said Sunday as drivers became familiar with the system, they tended to ignore audible warnings to retake the wheel. Still, Musk said the revised system will allow a driver’s hands to be off the wheel for up to three minutes while following a car at highway speeds. Shashua’s comments escalate an unusually public rift in an industry where suppliers and automakers rarely speak ill of each other in public. After Mobileye announced its break with Tesla in July in the wake of the fatality, Tesla said in a statement that Mobileye could not keep pace with Tesla’s product changes.  “Our parting ways was inevitable,” Musk told a press conference in late July. Shashua said the company had reservations about the mixed messages from Tesla about Autopilot   both boasting of its capabilities while cautioning that drivers needed to keep their hands on the wheel   especially after watching Tesla’s response to the Florida crash. “Long term this is going to hurt the interests of the company and hurt the interests of an entire industry, if a company of our reputation will continue to be associated with this type of pushing the envelope in terms of safety,” he said. The company counts as customers 27 automakers for its collision detection systems, which represent around 70 percent of the current market. Tesla and Musk have also said the Florida death was the first known fatality involving a car operating on Autopilot in 130 million miles of driving, and have contrasted that to the average of one death every 60 million miles of driving by vehicles worldwide.

Reuters,Q1ZBrian Snyder and Lisa Baertlein,Q1ZCleanup of Massachusetts Chipotle complete after norovirus scare,"Q1Z Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc received praise for its handling of potential norovirus infections at a   restaurant, as sick employees stayed home and the burrito chain quickly cleaned the restaurant. Shares of Chipotle fell as much as 6. 1 percent early, then gained back some ground after the head of the Billerica, Massachusetts public health department said the restaurant was cleaned and would reopen on Thursday. The stock closed down 3. 4 percent at $506. 63. The closure of the Chipotle in the Boston suburb was seen as a partial test of a new food safety system rolled out after a series of illnesses hit the fresh burrito chain last year.  That workers stayed home in particular was a good sign, said Doug Powell, publisher of the food safety site barfblog. com. ”It is an indication that the system is working,” he said. But customers may focus only on the sickness, not the company response. For burrito fans, ”It’s just   ooh, they’re barfing at Chipotle again,” Powell said. The company response was not a test of new measures to ensure ingredients are safe and avoid E. coli, he added. Chipotle food scares last year include two E. coli outbreaks linked to its restaurants that sickened more than 50 people in 10 states, as well as separate outbreaks of norovirus, a highly contagious virus known as the ”winter vomiting bug” in Massachusetts and California that involved more than 350 diners. Three employees are suspected to have norovirus in Billerica, the town’s Board of Health said. Earlier in the day, local Public Health Director Richard Berube told reporters that one of the three had been confirmed to have the virus. Berube said Chipotle has been ”very proactive” and remaining staff at the burrito restaurant would be screened for norovirus, he added. Berube, the company and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health all said no customers were known to be sick. ”They did the right thing,” said Howard Penney, who covers the chain for Hedgeye Risk Management. However, he argued that Chipotle was still a ”broken company” and that it would take years to return to its peak performance.  Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said the company closed the restaurant after employees called in sick. The restaurant closure comes as Chipotle has tried to lure back diners with coupons for a free burrito and other food. Chipotle sales have fallen sharply since the E. coli outbreaks came to light late last year. The stock traded above $750 last summer. Sales at established Chipotle restaurants tumbled 14. 6 percent in the fourth quarter, including a drop of 30 percent in the month of December.  ”The publicity around this news announcement will be another negative   that may affect consumer demand,” CRT Capital analyst Lynne Collier said in a client note. Chipotle temporarily closed all of its U. S. restaurants on Feb. 8 during prime lunch hours to hold staff meetings on food safety. Up to Tuesday’s close of $524. 69, the company’s stock had fallen about 18 percent since the first E. coli outbreak was reported on Oct. 31.

Reuters,Q1ZFrank Jack Daniel and Matt Spetalnick,"Q1ZNations urge Venezuela on elections, warn of diplomatic ’last resort’","Q1Z A group of 14 nations on Thursday urged Venezuela to hold elections and release ”political prisoners,” in a joint statement that kept open the option of seeking to suspend the South American country from the Organization of American States. The statement, which Mexico’s Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said was aimed at encouraging Venezuela to ”  democracy,” called for dialogue and negotiation to resolve a crisis in the   country, which is suffering severe food and fuel shortages.  Suspending Venezuela from the OAS was a last resort, the nations said, and something that should be avoided unless other diplomatic efforts have been exhausted.  ”We reiterate that inclusive and effective dialogue is the right path to achieve lasting solutions to the challenges faced by the Venezuelan people,” the statement said. Venezuela has jailed around 100 government opponents it accuses of inciting violence and planning the overthrow of President Nicolas Maduro. Opposition activists and human rights groups say they are prisoners of conscience. Venezuela’s election board in October suspended the opposition drive for a recall referendum against Maduro despite the country’s crushing economic crisis, the government’s unpopularity and public opinion in favor of a plebiscite. Venezuela has also delayed until 2017 elections due in December for state governorships. The declaration by the 14 nations called for the separation of powers, the rule of law and the establishment of an electoral calendar for postponed elections. The group that signed the declaration, which includes regional powerhouses the United States, Mexico, Canada and Brazil, also called on Venezuela to recognize the legitimacy of the country’s national assembly, which has been defanged by Maduro’s government since the opposition won a majority in 2015. Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela’s foreign minister, accused Washington of leading the new push to isolate her country, which has been at loggerheads with the United States since the   government of the late President Hugo Chavez. ”What are they trying? To wound Venezuela?” Rodriguez said on Twitter shortly before the statement was released. ”We will denounce these actions country by country. We will not allow any aggression against our sacred homeland.”  The pressure by countries including several former  Venezuelan allies follows a call by the head of the OAS to expel Venezuela if it does not quickly hold general elections, a move that would require the support of two thirds of the Washington based body’s 34 General Assembly members. Luis Almagro, secretary general of the OAS and a former foreign minister of Uruguay, calls Maduro’s government a dictatorship. Earlier this month he said if Venezuela did not quickly comply it should be suspended for violating rules that require members to adhere to democratic norms. In the past the OAS suspended Cuba and Honduras for breaking with democracy, but was criticized for not taking such action against   dictatorships during the Cold War. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States was concerned by the state of democracy in Venezuela. ”We urge the Venezuelan government to comply with the constitution . .. and hold elections as soon as possible,” Toner told a briefing for reporters. ”We’re not pushing for Venezuela’s expulsion from the OAS at this time. We do think that the OAS is the appropriate venue to deal with the situation in Venezuela.” However, a senior White House official said suspension from the regional body remained an option. Although numbers supporting Thursday’s declaration fell well short of the requirement to take strong action through the OAS, the official said the statement was a significant first step.  ”If Venezuela continues down the path that it’s on, the notion that it’s going to belong to an organization committed to democratic principles doesn’t make much sense,” the official told Reuters, adding that the United Sates could also consider sanctions. ”There are going to be ramifications,” the official said.  Mexico’s decision to openly take a stance on the situation in Venezuela is a shift from a usual preference by Latin America’s   economy not to interfere in other countries’ affairs. ”We should not continue to be indifferent, we cannot continue to be indifferent,” Videgaray said earlier on Thursday, emphasizing that Mexico would respect Venezuela’s sovereignty and act according to international law and in agreement with the countries of the Americas. Mexico’s change in tack may reflect an effort to have constructive relations with the administration of U. S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly antagonized Mexico.  ”Having the Mexicans in the lead is beneficial for us in attracting additional support,” the White House official said.

Reuters,Q1ZPete Schroeder,Q1ZFederal Reserve inconsistent in monitoring big banks: auditors,"Q1ZEach of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks nationwide had different guidance for how they continuously monitored large financial institutions, the study from the Office of the Inspector General found.  In fact, monitoring standards could vary from bank examiner to bank examiner within the same team, the study said, warning on how that could make it difficult to identify emerging risks. The report found that Fed examiners sometimes struggled with ”voluminous documentation” connected with the monitoring, and struggled to review all the information in a timely fashion. While extensive data collection was necessary during the financial crisis that began in 2008, the study questioned whether the same volume is needed now that banks are on more solid footing. Examiners said they were reluctant to reduce requests for documents and meetings for fear of missing important information. Melissa Heist, the associate inspector general for audits and evaluations at the Fed, sent the report to the central bank’s Board of Governors.  The inspector general also found that when documents were stored within the Fed, they were not efficiently organized, making it difficult for Fed examiners across the system to easily find and organize information across banks. The report suggested the Fed adopt a framework for managing monitoring documents and improve training and review of monitoring activities to ensure their effectiveness. Michael Gibson, director of supervision and regulation at the Fed Board of Governors, said in a March 21 letter to Mark Bialek, the Fed’s inspector general, that work was underway to address the specific recommendations.

Vox,Q1ZAndrew Prokop,"Q1ZThe state of the Republican presidential race, explained","Q1Z Is Donald Trump really going to be the Republican presidential nominee?    After his victories this week, this   outcome looks more likely than ever, and Republican elites are increasingly resigning themselves to it. But he hasn’t clinched it yet. Trump has built up such a lead in the delegate count at this point that he’s all but assured to finish with more delegates than any of his rivals. By our count, he has around 990 delegates, which places him very far ahead of Ted Cruz and John Kasich:         Indeed, both Cruz and Kasich have been mathematically eliminated from getting enough delegates to win on the convention’s first ballot, under the party’s current rules.    So the main drama now is not over whether Trump will get the most delegates, it’s about whether he’ll win an outright majority of delegates  —   1, 237, the magic number he needs to clinch the GOP nomination on the first ballot.    Right now, Trump has about 990 delegates. So he’s 247 or so away from the magic number, with 581 delegates still uncommitted or at stake in future primaries. The upshot is that Trump needs to win just 43 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch his majority.    But even if he falls a bit short of that majority, he now seems clearly on track to get very close to it. And the closer he gets, the more difficult it will be for the party to justify denying him the nomination. California and Indiana are the most important remaining states to watch The delegates that are still up for grabs fall into two main groups. There are about 500 delegates in the 10 states that haven’t voted yet, and then there are about 80 delegates who are uncommitted and free to support whomever they choose. The next state to vote is Indiana on this coming Tuesday, May 3, with 57 delegates at stake. In my view, this is the second most important state remaining, because it’s    (partly statewide, partly by congressional district) and has still seemed like it could tip to either Trump or Cruz. Most media commentators and politicos are interpreting Indiana as a   for Cruz at this point  —   if he loses it, his campaign will be deemed entirely dead rather than just mostly dead.    Four more states then vote in the remaining weeks of May. Of them, Nebraska is expected to give all its delegates to Cruz, West Virginia is expected to go strongly for Trump (though it has odd delegate allocation rules that could depress his total somewhat) and the candidates will split Oregon and Washington’s delegates due to proportional allocation. All this leads up to the final day of GOP primary voting: June 7, when five states will vote.   New Jersey is a    state that Trump is expected to win easily.  South Dakota and Montana are also    states, and are expected to go to Cruz.  New Mexico is another proportional state where the delegates will be split.  But the day’s biggest prize, and the state that will likely determine whether Trump clinches his majority, is California. There are 172 delegates at stake there, and 159 of them will be allotted    on the congressional district level (three delegates in each of the state’s 53 districts)  —   which means that broad strength across the state will be necessary to pick up most of its delegates. If Trump doesn’t manage to hit his magic number by June 7, however, he’ll still have some time before the   convention. And in the interim, he’ll work to win over those uncommitted delegates to try to get him over the top. (They’re from various states and territories due to quirks in local rules, including North Dakota, Pennsylvania, American Samoa, and Guam.) Trump could also try to peel some unbound delegates who have endorsed Cruz away from him, perhaps arguing that the party should avert a divisive and damaging contested convention. According to a tally by PhD student Daniel Nichanian, Cruz has 24 of these delegates. (Trump has been endorsed by 30 or so unbound delegates that could in theory defect from him, too.) Convention shenanigans to block Trump are possible theoretically but a tough sell practically So, you may be wondering, is the Republican Party really stuck with Donald Trump as its nominee? Can they really do nothing to stop him?    In fact, the 2, 472 delegates who go to the convention have a great deal of power  —   so much so that they probably could prevent Trump’s nomination if they really, really wanted to. The problem is that this would badly flout the modern norm that a party’s voters determine the party’s presidential nominee, and would cause a tremendous backlash  —   a backlash for which the party doesn’t appear to have an appetite. First of all, if Trump doesn’t lock down that majority of delegates on the first ballot, then he doesn’t become the nominee just yet. Multiple rounds of balloting will ensue, and more and more delegates will become freed up to vote for whomever they want. But what would happen after that isn’t clear. Many have argued that since Trump has done a bad job of ensuring his supporters are installed as his delegates, party support would surely swing elsewhere as a second ballot. Yet polling shows that Republican voters think the candidate with the most delegates from primary voting should get the nomination. So it’s possible that the delegates would be hesitant to defy what they perceive to be the public will to nominate the candidate who came in second or someone who didn’t run at all.            Second, even if Trump does get an apparent delegate majority before the convention, there are various ways the delegates could, theoretically, change that. Most of these would involve changing the convention’s rules to tip the balance against Trump, which the delegates are perfectly free to do should they so desire  —   they have a lot of power! Yet the delegates will know full well that the more they actually use these powers to sway the outcome, the greater the backlash they’ll provoke. If current trends continue, Trump will have won the most delegates in primaries, the most votes, the most states. If GOP delegates change the rules at the last minute to block his nomination, it will (accurately) appear that they were trying to ”steal” the election from Trump, and infuriate his many supporters.    Recent evidence has pointed toward the party starting to resign itself to the inevitability of a Trump nomination, rather than gearing up for an intensely controversial effort to block him:   Single biggest thing Trump has going for him now is this attitude taking hold in the party: https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) April 22, 2016    So that’s where we appear to be  —   Trump is doing well enough, and his rivals have been doing poorly enough, that while it’s still unclear whether he’ll get his delegate majority, it’s tougher than ever to imagine the Republican Party stopping him.

Vox,Q1ZTimothy B. Lee,"Q1ZSnapchat’s $25 billion initial public offering, explained for people over 30","Q1Z Snapchat is working on an initial public offering, which would allow members of the public to become investors in one of the internet’s hottest startups. That’s according to the Wall Street Journal, which reports that Snapchat expects to value the company at around $25 billion.    If you’re under 30, you’re probably excited at the prospect of one of your favorite apps getting some recognition from Wall Street. If you’re over 30, on the other hand, you’re probably bewildered that an app you’ve never used could possibly be worth $25 billion. The big question for Wall Street is going to be what Snapchat’s extremely lopsided age distribution means for the app’s future growth. The optimistic view is that Snapchat is a   app that  —   like Facebook a decade ago  —   will simply take a few years to filter up from young people to their grandmothers. The pessimistic view is that Snapchat will never broaden its appeal beyond young people, and may even wind up being rendered irrelevant as fickle teens move on to the next communications app. What is Snapchat? Again, if you’re under 30, you can skip to the next question. For everyone else, Snapchat is a messaging app first released in 2011. Users of the original Snapchat used the app to send each other pictures  —   often selfies  —   that would disappear after a few seconds.    Like most new internet activities, this seemed totally pointless to the old people of the day, but teenagers loved it. Snapchat messages, known as snaps, were a quick and easy way for friends to let each other know they were thinking of each other. The informality and ephemerality of snaps made people more willing to send them on a whim  —   much as an earlier generation of teenagers would wave to each other as they passed in the hallway between classes.    By 2014, Snapchat had grown to more than 100 million monthly users, and it recently passed 150 million daily users, edging out Twitter. Snapchat has steadily added new features. The app allows users to engage in both text and video chat. It added a new section called Discover that allowed professional news and entertainment brands (including Vox) to publish video content to Snapchat’s platform. Snapchat allows users to create stories  —   essentially slideshows of photos and videos that are available to friends for 24 hours.    Ultimately, founder Evan Spiegel believes that competing messaging apps are too complex and   draining mobile chat of the spontaneity of    conversations. Is Snapchat really worth $25 billion? We don’t know that Snapchat is worth $25 billion. According to the Wall Street Journal, that’s how much Snapchat hopes its stock will be worth on the open market, but we won’t know if it’s right until the IPO actually happens. But it’s not a crazy number by any means. Snapchat has 150 million daily active users, making it more popular than Twitter by this measure. Twitter has essentially stopped growing, and the market values it at around $17 billion. So if Snapchat is about as big as Twitter and still growing, a valuation of $25 billion seems quite plausible.    Why is the company worth so much? The simple answer is that 150 million people is a massive opportunity for advertisers to reach a broad cross section of young people in the United States and around the world. Twitter, for example, generated $2. 2 billion in advertising revenue last year. When new online platform emerge, people often get hung up on the fact that they don’t seem to be generating as much revenue as existing online platforms. Snapchat, for example, is projected to generate $1 billion in ad revenues in 2017  —   less than half the $2. 2 billion Twitter generated in 2015. But revenues are a lagging indicator of success for a service like Snapchat. At this point, we have a very good idea how to transform millions of active users into millions of dollars of ad revenue. If Snapchat keeps attracting more users, generating billions in ad revenue will be easy. The big question, then, is what happens to Snapchat’s growth in the future. If Snapchat keeps growing, $25 billion could wind up looking like a bargain. If growth stalls, Snapchat could find itself in Twitter’s predicament in the past few years. Speaking as a    whose job includes paying attention to apps like Snapchat, I’ve been struck by how few of my friends seem to use the service. According to a   Consult poll that will be released in a few days, 54 percent of people ages 30 to 44 say they never use Snapchat, compared with 26 percent of those under 30 and 82 percent of those ages 45 to 54. So Snapchat use really is heavily skewed toward the young. Yet young people tend to love it, and after five years usage of the app is still growing. So maybe in a few years, we old people will find out what we’ve been missing. ",Q1Z2016/10/6Z1Q

Vox,Q1ZZack Beauchamp,Q1ZLondon Parliament attack: what we know so far,"Q1Z British authorities have identified the suspected perpetrator of Wednesday’s bloody attack outside the parliament complex in central London that left five dead, including one police officer and the assailant, and at least 30 wounded, some grievously.     Law enforcement personnel said Khalid Masood, 52, carried out the assault, the deadliest terror attack in London in more than a decade. Masood, whose birth name was Adrian Russell Ajao, was born in Kent, England.  ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, but police have said they believe Masood was acting alone. He was already known to MI5, the British intelligence agency, although apparently was not high on their list of concerns.  The identities of some of the victims became clearer on Thursday as well. The dead police officer was identified as Keith Palmer, 48. The other fatalities were    Aysha Frade, a Spanish teacher and mother of two, and American Kurt Cochran, who had been in London to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary. CNN reported that his wife Melissa was among those wounded in the attack.     Here is a guide to what we know about the incident.  What we know  Early on Wednesday, a car careened out of traffic on Westminster Bridge, a bridge over the River Thames adjacent to Parliament, plowing through pedestrians and eventually crashing. At least 10 people were treated for injuries on Westminister Bridge itself, according to the London Ambulance Service.  Shortly afterward, a lone attacker armed with two knives entered the grounds of Parliament. The assailant was confronted by police on the grounds before he could gain entry to the Parliament building. The assailant managed to stab one police officer before being shot, according to CBS News.  The officer later died.  Metropolitan Police Assistant Deputy Commissioner Mark Rowley has confirmed that four people, including the attacker, died in the initial attack on Wednesday. At least 30 people were injured. One of the injured, a    man, died in the hospital Thursday.  Rowley named the police officer who died as Keith Palmer, a    husband and father. Among the injured are at least three French teenage schoolchildren.  No members of Parliament were among the wounded. After the breach, Prime Minister Theresa May was taken away to safety, and the building was put on lockdown.  ",Q1Z2017/3/22Z1Q
Vox,Q1ZTressie McMillan Cottom,Q1ZGeorgetown’s slavery announcement is remarkable. But it’s not reparations.,"Q1Z Georgetown University did something remarkable this week. The university issued a set of plans to “reconcile” (quoting Georgetown President John J. DeGioia) its role in benefitting from slavery.    The plan is a response to work done by the institution’s “Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation” committee, convened in 2015. And it is part of a larger movement among colleges and universities to acknowledge their   pasts as well as how wealth from slavery built many of our nation’s greatest institutions. It also has implications for the larger conversation around what America as a whole should do to reckon with its history of enslaving black people. Let me be clear: Excavating this history and acknowledging how it shapes present inequalities is important. In this context, Georgetown’s plan is a fine thing. It is not, however, reparations.  Reparations must be specific to the context and the type of harm causedI make that claim because the counterclaim has been made. The Chronicle of Higher Education called the Georgetown plan “the university’s reparations. ” Responding to a New York Times   lauding Georgetown’s initiatives,   Coates, who wrote an article for the Atlantic two years ago calling for reparations, said, “it’s reparations. ”    I’m a sociologist who studies and teaches inequality, especially as it relates to higher education. I support reparations for African Americans, similar to those paid to Japanese Americans, and all manner of other policies to redistribute wealth for a more just social contract. To understand why the Georgetown plan isn’t reparations, let’s begin with what it is.    Georgetown will name two buildings for black Americans, one an enslaved man and the other a free woman of color. The university will also extend preferred admissions status to the descendants of slaves who can be identified as those who provided uncompensated labor at the university. An institute will be established that will, in part, research those genealogies. Now let’s talk about what the plan does not offer: any form of compensation for unpaid labor, in historical or current dollars or any   payment. The Georgetown commission recommended tuition support, but there are no plans to do that at this time.    Reparations has three components: acknowledgement, restitution, and closure. The argument about whether Georgetown’s plan constitutes reparations hinges on the first two notions.  The first is that acknowledgement is a necessary condition of reparations. That is, the party who caused or benefits from the offense must acknowledge harm and accept responsibility for it. By this measure, one of the most amazing aspects of Georgetown’s plan is that it does that in unequivocal terms. President DeGioia couldn’t be more clear that the university “participated in the institution of slavery and benefitted” from the sale of slaves. In a nation in which many people still consider enslavement an unfortunate but at least expeditious route to citizenship for the enslaved, that is a strong statement.  But if reparations were merely acknowledging harm, the word would be redundant. What does reparations mean if it means something that includes acknowledgement but is also something more than acknowledgement?    The idea that preferred admission equals payment stems from the American ideology that opportunity, especially educational opportunity, is a “fair” form of recompenseThat’s where the second condition for reparations comes in: Scholars who accept the idea of reparations (some do not) generally agree that reparations must be specific to the context and the type of harm caused. Georgetown could apologize for a great many harms related to racism. It could apologize for gentrification, for example, or hiring discrimination. All universities are guilty of this to some degree.  But Georgetown is specifically apologizing for slavery and its role in it. Georgetown has set the terms for the specificity of the claim: profiting from enslaved labor. Given these terms, set by the institution itself, the specific claim to reparations is uncompensated labor. Reparations would mean making recompense for this harm specific to the claim. Reparations means paying someone for that labor. The idea that preferred admission equals payment stems from the American ideology that opportunity, especially educational opportunity, is a “fair” form of recompense. Opportunity has a moral basis: It will only be valuable for those who deserve it and will not inconvenience or harm those who already have the opportunity (whether they deserve it or not). Our society likes opportunity because it does not demand redistribution of resources acquired through harm. As you can tell, I’m not a fan of this logic. But even if I were, preferred admission doesn’t equate to much of an opportunity. Preferred admissions gives a narrowly defined group of black descendants a chance to compete for achievements that are defined by accumulated disadvantage. The chance to be preferred in admissions to Georgetown still relies on racial differences in college preparation, racial wealth, and income gaps that condition the ability to pay college tuition, and racial gaps in knowledge about competitive college admissions. Preferential admissions says if you somehow manage to navigate all those other legacies of slavery  —   wealth disparities, income disparities, information disparities  —   then we will give you additional consideration in admissions. That is generous when judged by how little other universities have done but it is not much of an opportunity and it isn’t a form of payment at all.  Actual reparations has three components: acknowledgement, restitution, and closureEven if it were, there is the issue of education being equal to payment. It isn’t. As I have said many times, education is not and cannot ever be reparations. For African Americans, educational attainment makes us better off than the average African American  —   we earn more than lesser educated brethren and have better life outcomes and more income stability. But compared to whites who don’t have any college education, college educated blacks still have less income, less mobility, and less wealth.  For admissions to Georgetown to come close to equaling payment for unpaid labor, its credential would have to be worth its weight in income. The evidence suggests that for blacks that simply is not the case. An education buys one an extra chance at income and wealth. It doesn’t guarantee it. You don’t admit you owe someone money and repay them with lottery tickets.    Examples abound of what reparations could look like. It could be an endowment for every African American child born in the United States, as Darrick Hamilton and Sandy Darity argue in their “baby bonds” proposal. That kind of individual reparations plan would be paired with institutional reparations programs, including tuition assistance to colleges like Georgetown but also business financing and community development. The key to these plans is that they quantify the debt owed and then they pay it. Without restitution, acknowledgement cannot lead to closure. And without closure, reparations haven’t been made. And without reparations, true reconciliation  —   restoring wholeness  —   cannot happen. If preferred admissions isn’t reparations, it is as a type of affirmative action. In fact, it is odd that so many media outlets stretched to call Georgetown’s plan reparations when it so closely resembles affirmative action policies. Even the language of “legacy admissions,” the concept this plan expands to include the descendants of the enslaved, comes from affirmative action frameworks.  This is, at best, a specific narrow case of affirmative action, repurposed to address a problem rooted in claims to reparations. To call affirmative action reparations is to extend the moral superiority of the latter to the mundane application of the former. If universities want credit, spiritual and political capital, for doing reparations, they should have to actually do reparations. Anything less than that merely rebrands one accomadationist policy for another, gutting each one’s revolutionary potential for real reconciliation and recompense. If we call everything reparations, then nothing is reparations. And maybe, for some, that is the point.

Washington Post,Q1ZJonathan O'Connell,"Q1ZDonald Trump, José Andrés and the death of a grand Washington restaurant","Q1Z     He called it Topo Atrio, his vision for a sumptuous hotel restaurant befitting a $200 million makeover of the Old Post Office Pavilion on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. José Andrés designed a      dining room clad in travertine limestone and trimmed in gold. Costing nearly $7 million to build, it would feature   cured ham from the   Iberico pigs of his native Spain and squid ink pasta with   red shrimp, cuttlefish and aioli. But as Andrés prepared to present his final plans, the man whose name would be on the new hotel, Donald Trump, had some business of his own. The billionaire developer took the stage at Trump Tower in New York to announce his candidacy for president and, in the process, railed against Mexican immigrants as drug dealers and rapists. Just over a week later, the chief executive at Andrés’s restaurant company picked up her iPhone and fired a quick message to Trump’s daughter Ivanka with the subject: We need to talk. “Getting crushed over DJT comments about Latinos and Mexicans. Need your help,” she wrote last summer. So began the end of what seemed a promising pairing of celebrity developer and internationally renowned chef, each hoping to trade on the other’s fame. Instead the two are suing each other, filling a court file with affidavits and correspondence chronicling what has become a stubborn standoff between two powerful personalities. Trump has taken a particular interest in the Old Post Office project, citing it on the campaign trail as a symbol of his business acumen and bragging it will be open when the nation is ready to inaugurate its next president. In the fallout over the restaurant deal, he wasted little time in personally seizing the more than $250, 000 Andrés’s company had set aside as collateral at the start of the project. The outspoken Trump has said little about the court fight, and he and company officials declined to comment for this story. Andrés and his team, too, declined comment on the ongoing legal matter, but the native of Spain who became a U. S. citizen in 2013 has not kept quiet about his opposition to candidate Trump. “Dear @MSNBC and @FOXTV why do you give so much live tv to somebody who is a racist, a divider? Somebody who doesn’t love USA, but himself? ,” Andrés tweeted in March. Still, court records show difficulties Andrés may face in court. The contract with Trump includes no morality clause that the chef could invoke to say he was harmed. And the agreement specifically excludes a trial by jury, saying that any dispute that lands in court must be decided by a judge. For now, Andrés’s attorneys are building a case around the damage that they say Trump’s comments had on the restaurant’s prospects, and the company has been busy surveying potential investors, patrons and employees of the restaurant to gauge the effect of Trump’s attacks on immigrants  —   and, in particular, Hispanics. Both sides appear to be digging in. As Trump said during a March news conference: “I don’t settle lawsuits  —   very rare  —   because once you settle lawsuits, everybody sues you. ”    José Andrés in his Minibar restaurant in Washington. He emailed the Trumps the day after a critical meeting was canceled. (AP   Martin, File)  D. C.’s ‘most exciting location’ When Andrés began serving   small plates on Seventh Street in 1993, there was no basketball arena downtown, Metro’s Green Line was only two years old and the neighborhood’s current moniker, Penn Quarter, had not been coined. The city’s restaurant boom was two decades off. Andrés built his empire with business partner Rob Wilder one restaurant at a time, adding Zaytinya, Oyamel, Beefsteak and others in the District, plus outposts in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami and Puerto Rico. Success in the kitchen advanced him as a television star, philanthropist and celebrity, one whom Time Magazine named one of the world’s most influential people in 2012. Andrés became one of the few international food stars distinct to Washington, his adopted home town, where he has a bar, food truck and seven area restaurants and has been lauded by officials for his investments and belief in the city. The chef’s stature in the District was attractive to the developer, whose sons and daughter handle    operations. Although they have hotels in five American cities and three foreign countries, the Trumps pride themselves on building getaways for their   guests that feel of and about the places they are in, even if they are all encased in the same shimmer and shine. To that end, the Trump International Hotel, Washington, D. C. is to feature large “presidential” suites, public access to the historic clock tower on the roof and a curated museum dedicated to the 19th century building and the Bells of Congress that hang above. Ivanka, who oversaw its development and who lived in Washington briefly while attending Georgetown University, has repeatedly talked about respecting the building’s historic place in the city even as she designed the spa and bathrooms trimmed in gold. “Anyone who is concerned about how we may alter or affect the historic character of the building can be assuaged by looking at our plans,” she said in 2012, seeking to reassure preservationists. “This isn’t, I think, a very polarizing concept. ” In search of a D. C. chef to match, the Trumps refrained from using their New York connections and hired a restaurant adviser, Bethesda, Md.  Streetsense, that they met through D. C. developer Douglas Jemal. Andrés was not the only big name in Washington they approached. Early on, the Trumps, according to executives familiar with the search, contacted Patrick O’Connell of the famed Inn at Little Washington in Rappahannock County, Va. about opening a D. C. flagship restaurant. Ultimately, Trump and his family settled on Andrés, agreeing to hand him the hotel’s marquee space, one to be built on a raised platform next to the hotel lobby. Court documents describe their agreement: The   lease  —   technically a sublease because the Trumps lease the building from the government  —   gave Andrés the    space for 10 years. Andrés agreed to pay $28, 750 a month for the first five years, $31, 625 a month for the next five, and would receive a cut of the profit. The Trumps would also pay for the chef’s likeness and promotional abilities, even in situations when he had little or no responsibility for cooking or preparing food. The main “Cortile Bar” would serve drinks and bar food featuring Andrés’s “culinary expertise,” although he would not operate it. In return, Andrés would get a 5 percent cut of food sales and a 4 percent cut of drink receipts. He also would get 5 percent of sales from a “José Andrés Banquet Menu. ” Andrés agreed not to open another hotel restaurant downtown. The chef outlined his concept for Topo Atrio in the contract with no shortage of romance: “Into the heart of Washington DC at the city’s newest, most luxurious and iconic hotel comes José Andrés’ own iconic, flagship restaurant  —   a modern, fine dining approach to the Spanish cuisine for which he’s internationally known. ”  For Andrés, the restaurant would be one of his biggest, and most expensive. He and Trump seemed happy with the deal. Trump issued a news release in December 2014: “We’ve tapped one of the very best in the field . . . to create a restaurant concept that will live up to the unrivaled offerings of what will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world. ” The chef tweeted a picture of himself enjoying a round of golf at Trump National Doral in Miami. Then, six months after the agreement, Trump began his run for president on June 16, launching a rhetorical war against immigrants with these comments: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. . . . They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. ”    Real estate developer Donald Trump walks with sons Eric Trump, left, and Donald Trump Jr. and daughter Ivanka Trump outside the Old Post Office Pavilion. Ivanka Trump tried to save Topo Atrio after her father’s comments on immigration. (Julia  )  An agreement sours Nine days passed before Kimberly Grant, chief executive of Andrés’ company, ThinkFoodGroup, emailed Ivanka Trump for help, according to an exchange filed as part of the legal case. Her message did not appear to surprise Donald Trump Jr. who wrote back after being forwarded the message: “Yes I was waiting for that one. ” The Trump executive assigned to developing the hotel, David Orowitz, voiced his frustration in an email contained in the public court file. At the time, the Trumps were hoping to open a year later, in June 2016. “Ugh. This is not surprising and would expect that this will not be the last we hear of it. At least for formal, prepared speeches, can someone vet going forward? Hopefully the Latino community does not organize against us more broadly in DC   across Trump properties. ” In typical hotel restaurant deals, the owner builds the restaurant and hires a chef to manage it. In this case the Trumps  —   who had agreed to spend $200 million on the project, far more than other bidders  —   negotiated a deal in which Andrés would pay to design and build his own restaurant. They wanted the chef to have skin in the game, and he agreed. Andrés, who had enlisted New York architect David Rockwell, has estimated building his share of the restaurant would cost $5. 4 million, which would require taking out a $3. 6 million commercial loan. By June of last year, ThinkFoodGroup estimated that it had spent more than $350, 000 on designs and plans, court records show. Marketing and design executives on both sides worked to advance the plans. After seeing the latest design, Trump’s interior designer, Giavona Pirolo emailed that Ivanka “really loved” the new presentation and offered some advice for presenting to Trump, or “DJT. ”     ThinkFoodGroup’s chief marketing officer, Michael Doneff, wrote back that Andrés approved of tweaks from the Trump side, as long as “we preserve the travertine and temper the shine. ” Before Trump announced his candidacy, a major design meeting had been scheduled for June 30, in which Andrés and Rockwell would present their latest vision in a large conference room on the 25th floor of Trump Tower in New York to Donald Trump, Ivanka, Don Jr. and other executives. Then came Donald Trump’s campaign remarks, and top executives on both sides sought to manage the fallout with their bosses. According to emails, Ivanka connected her father and the chef days before the planned meeting. Grant wrote her in appreciation:     Indeed, the afternoon before the meeting, the chef tweeted a lukewarm defense of the deal, writing that “as everybody knows don’t agree or support in any way or form with his comments. @thinkfoodgroup is just leasing a space in his hotel. ” But the star chef never appeared the next day and the meeting was canceled. The chef wrote Ivanka and Don Jr. the next morning:     Five days later, on July 6, Trump continued his broadside on immigration with another statement: “What can be simpler or more accurately stated? The Mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc. ” An online petition from D. C. resident Erick Sanchez urging Andrés to pull out received 2, 769 signatures in six days. While the names were still coming, Andrés sent The Washington Post a statement saying that the restaurant could no longer open and condemning Trump’s position on immigration: “I believe that every human being deserves respect, regardless of immigration status. ” ThinkFoodGroup wrote to the Trump Organization, saying that “Jose Andres’ success is built on an   call to the world to say ‘Welcome! Comemos! Enjoy!’ And we now have a landlord whose message is ‘Go home, criminals, and take your infectious diseases with you.’ ” In August of last year, Trump sued Andrés for $10 million. Calculating losses After Andrés countersued for $8 million, the two sides began fighting in court. Trump’s attorneys have tried to play down the presidential candidate’s role in the restaurant negotiations, saying that Don Jr. Ivanka and their brother Eric are responsible for the    management and operation of the Old Post Office project. On the campaign trail, Trump has offered a different impression. “I built an amazing company,” he said in March after Mitt Romney called his career into question. “And one of the reasons you know it’s amazing: The hottest development site, probably in the history of the General Services Administration . . . is the Old Post Office site . . . in Washington D. C. an entire block fronting on Pennsylvania Avenue. In other words, if I don’t get to the White House, I’m getting there anyway. ” It was also Trump himself who signed the lease with ThinkFoodGroup. And it is his signature on the document withdrawing $258, 171 ThinkFoodGroup had put up as collateral after the chef backed out, according to court filings.     Trump may also have to appear personally to respond to the fuss over his comments, as the judge in a parallel case, between the developer and chef Geoffrey Zakarian  —   who backed out of a lease for a second restaurant in the hotel  —   ordered Trump to make himself available in Washington to be deposed in that case. Attorneys have not taken depositions and the details probably will fall under court orders allowing some testimony to be kept secret. Andrés and his attorneys have constructed a lengthy argument that after the candidate’s comments, potential investors, employees and patrons of Topo Atrio  —   particularly Hispanic ones  —   would have steered clear of the restaurant, dooming it. Restaurant investor Todd Klein, who has backed 10 ThinkFoodGroup restaurants, submitted an affidavit saying that the comments “had the effect of eroding the establishment’s projected client base, which, in turn, increased the risk that the establishment would be unable to pay its debt. ” Other potential investors and ThinkFoodGroup’s banker, Robert P. Pincus of EagleBank, applauded the move. “Congratulations, Trump left TFG and Jose NO choice,” Pincus wrote in an email to the company. ThinkFoodGroup also tried to ascertain how many of its employees and patrons were Hispanic. After surveying 1, 215 employees at a dozen of its restaurants, it found that 51 percent were Hispanic. As of last summer, the company estimates that Hispanic patrons made 11 percent of online reservations at its restaurants, as well as 15 percent of online reservations at local Jaleo locations. ThinkFoodGroup has estimated that it would receive a profit of $1. 1 million over the first six years of operation. Removing 12 percent for its estimated Hispanic business, it calculated that Topo Atrio would instead lose a similar amount. “Trump should have known that his statements on immigration would have an adverse impact on the development of a Spanish   restaurant in a   building,” Andrés’s attorneys say in court documents. Worse, they suggested that “fine dining patrons eschew controversial sites,” which could have turned off diners of any ethnicity to his restaurants. D. C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) came to the chef’s defense, telling Ivanka that she did not want to see one of her local businesses bullied. “One of our business owners could be harmed in some dealings with the Trumps, which troubles me a lot,” Bowser said in an interview. “So we really would like them to resolve that. ” Trump’s attorneys argue the estimates are misleading and add that the candidate’s comments have no bearing on the lease. In documents that remain under seal, the Trumps also allege, according to two people familiar with the case, that Andrés may have had reservations before he pulled out. “They were frustrated with the design and construction process and behind generally on getting the documents done,” said one official familiar with the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is ongoing. Andrés’s attorneys deny the allegations in court filings. The evidence produced by ThinkFoodGroup “is as irrelevant as evidence of how many delegates or votes Mr. Trump has received in the Republican primaries,” Trump’s attorney told the court. Trump’s position on immigration, his attorney argued, wasn’t new and his “willingness to frankly share his opinions” was widely known. Though both sides are jockeying for legal advantage now, most such disagreements end in a settlement. Last fall the Trumps announced that BLT Prime, owned by New York’s ESquared Hospitality, would take over the restaurant space. Chef Oliver Beckert would oversee room service, catering and banquet services. Though he has avoided commenting on the ongoing legal wrangling, Andrés did take to Twitter days before the Republican primary in Maryland, tweeting a link to an   editorial and adding a message: “PEOPLE OF Maryland! remember! When You vote remember who only cares about himself?” Trump won the state’s primary with 54 percent of the vote.

Washington Post,Q1ZMichael E. Miller,"Q1ZWhite high school football players in Idaho charged in rape of black, disabled teammate with a coat hanger","Q1Z       When a teammate held out his arms after football practice in their high school locker room, the student thought he was about to get a hug. Instead, he got viciously raped, authorities say. As the teammate restrained the victim, another football player allegedly thrust a coat hanger into the victim’s rectum, according to a criminal complaint. Then a third teammate kicked the coat hanger several times. The Oct. 23, 2015, incident has rocked the tiny town of Dietrich, Idaho. This spring, after several months of investigation, the state attorney general’s office filed sexual assault charges against the three. Two of the teenagers are being charged as adults and could face life in prison, under Idaho law. Earlier this month, the victim’s family filed a $10 million lawsuit against Dietrich High School. According to the lawsuit, the attack wasn’t a   but rather the culmination of months of racist abuse by white students against the victim, who is black. The victim “was taunted and called racist names by other members of the team which names included ‘ ’ ‘chicken eater’ ‘watermelon’ and [the  ],” the suit alleges. The civil complaint filed in the U. S. District Court in Idaho also claims that one of the students charged with sexual assault displayed a Confederate flag and demanded the victim recite a racist song titled “Notorious KKK. ” All three of the attackers were white, the suit says. The suit, which names the    victim, was provided to The Washington Post by his attorney. However, The Post generally does not name victims of sexual assault. In addition to Dietrich High School, the lawsuit also names 11 employees as defendants. It claims school administrators and coaches did nothing to stop the racial and physical abuse toward the victim, who was especially vulnerable due to “mental disorders including learning disabilities. ” The suit claims that Dietrich football coaches encouraged other players to fight the victim, allowing a much larger student to knock him unconscious as other students shouted “catcalls, taunts and racial epithets. ” Dietrich High School did not respond to a request for comment.    Dietrich, Idaho  Against the allegation of widespread racial abuse at Dietrich, one individual stands out: John R. K. Howard. Howard, 18, is one of the three accused. He is charged as an adult with one count of forcible penetration by use of force or a foreign object, according to the criminal complaint. Howard, who is finishing high school in Texas, has a preliminary hearing set for June 10 and has not yet entered a plea. The civil suit paints Howard as the ringleader of the racist abuse against the victim, who was adopted at age 4 by white parents living in the predominantly white town of 334 people. “Mr. Howard is a large and aggressive male who had been sent to live with his relatives in Idaho due to his inability to keep out of trouble in Texas,” the lawsuit says. “Mr. Howard is a relative of prominent individuals in the community and, at least in part due to his athletic ability and community connections, the Defendants ignored or were deliberately indifferent to the behavior of Mr. Howard which included aggression, taunting and bullying of The Plaintiff and other students in the District. With deliberate indifference, the Defendants did nothing to curb the vicious acts of Mr. Howard who brought with him from Texas a culture of racial hatred towards the Plaintiff. ” The victim, one of the few black students at Dietrich, let alone on his football team, was subjected to frequent abuse by Howard and his fellow teammates, including “aggressive ‘humping’ jumping on him from the back and simulating anal sex,” according to the suit. His fellow football players allegedly gave him painful wedgies, stripped him of his clothes and took naked photos of him in the locker room. One student drew a picture of the victim sitting in the back of the bus on a classroom chalkboard. It was Howard, however, who the suit alleges was behind the worst abuse. It was Howard who forced the victim to recite the words to “Notorious KKK,” a bitterly racist and violent rap song set to the tune of Notorious B. I. G. ’s “Can’t You See,” the suit alleges. It was Howard who, with his bare fists, knocked out the victim, who was made to wear boxing gloves, as teammates and coaches formed a circle around them, the suit says. And it was Howard who kicked the coat hanger five or six times, causing the victim “rectal injuries” that required hospital treatment, the lawsuit claims. Another player,    wide receiver Tanner Ward, has been also been charged as an adult with forcible penetration, according to local news website MagicValley. com. According to the lawsuit, Ward, “physically forced a coat hanger into the Plaintiff’s rectum” before Howard kicked it. A lawyer representing Ward did not return requests for comment. A third football player, age 16, has been charged as a juvenile. His name has not been released. Last month, during a preliminary hearing in the case against Ward, the victim testified how he had been tricked with kindness moments before the cruel attack: He said Howard and Ward started harassing him before practice on Oct. 22, giving him a “power wedgie” so violent it tore his boxers. That was nothing compared with what would come after practice, however. When the third teammate asked the victim for a hug, he agreed, only for the teammate to restrain him and signal for the others to attack, the victim said. “I screamed,” he testified, according to MagicValley. com. “I was pretty upset. I felt really bad. A little bit betrayed and confused at the same time. It was terrible  —   a pain I’ve never felt. ” Ward’s attorney argued that the victim’s testimony conflicted with that of another witness, but Judge Mark Ingram allowed the case to continue. Ward’s trial is scheduled to begin on Sept. 26. The Lincoln County Clerk’s Office could not say Tuesday whether he had filed a plea.

Washington Post,Q1ZRobert Barnes,Q1ZAlito’s guideline on issues of Americans’ liberties: ‘What would Scalia do?’,"Q1Z Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. on Thursday said free speech and religious liberty hang in the balance at the Supreme Court and warned of other issues along the “constitutional fault lines” that might confront the divided justices. A little more than a week ago, it seemed those issues would come before a court with a liberal majority for the first time in nearly half a century. Instead, the election of Donald Trump is likely to mean a restoration of the conservative majority that prevailed before the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February.   In a speech before the conservative Federalist Society’s National Lawyers Convention, Alito did not mention the election or the vacancy on the court. But he listed the issues that concern him, including gun rights and alleged overreach by government agencies, and said they should be answered with this thought in mind: “What would Scalia do?” That is pretty much the theme of the   conference that opened Thursday. Scalia was an early supporter of the Federalist Society, which supports a conservative view of the Constitution and has been an active participant in advising Republican presidents on filling the federal judiciary. The society, along with the Heritage Foundation, helped produce a list of potential nominees from which Trump says he will make his Supreme Court choice. Nine of the 21 people on the list have been participating in the conference.  The mood was jovial. An organization that has been on defense for the past eight years  —   a home to those mounting legal challenges to President Obama’s policies  —   is ready to play offense again. Alito steered clear of any direct mention of that. But he noted that some of the issues that most concerned him were decided by    majorities and said the “constitutional fault lines” were dangerous places. “Sometimes the earth starts to tremor and people get worried about what’s coming,” Alito said. In District of Columbia v. Heller, for instance, the court decided in 2008 that “the Second Amendment actually means what it says,” Alito said, and protects an individual right to own a firearm for  . But Justice Stephen G. Breyer’s dissent in the case “provides a road map for denaturing Heller without actually overruling it,” Alito said. Likewise, Alito said he was alarmed that more than 40 senators were willing to amend the Constitution to overturn the court’s ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, which held that restrictions on corporate and union political spending violated   rights. “What would that amendment do?” Alito said. “It would have the effect of granting greater   rights to an elite group  —   those who control the media  —   than to everybody else. ” Religious freedoms, Alito said, are “in even greater danger. ” Quoting “the latest recipient of the Nobel Prize for literature,” Bob Dylan, Alito said, “It’s not dark yet, but its getting there. ” Alito objected to the court’s decision in June not to review a requirement in the state of Washington that pharmacies dispense emergency contraceptives to women. It was challenged by pharmacists who said that they considered some of the drugs to be tantamount to abortion and that dispensing them violated their religious beliefs.  Alito said he missed Scalia in ways that transcend the court’s jurisprudence. In the court’s arguments and conferences since February, Alito said, “there has been a palpable emptiness in the room. Something vital is obviously missing. ” After speaking to the Federalist Society chapter at Columbia University, Alito said, he was given a   that read “WWSD,” a play on the popular Christian slogan “What would Jesus do? “At the time, it struck me as slightly sacrilegious,” Alito said, adding, “Now the question is real. ” ",Q1Z2016-11-17Z1Q
Washington Post,Q1ZEllen Nakashima,Q1ZWikiLeaks pledges to release software code of CIA hacking tools to tech firms,"Q1Z WikiLeaks will release to tech firms the software code of CIA hacking tools that were designed to compromise smartphones and other products, the group’s founder said Thursday, attempting to position himself as a defender of cybersecurity and probably further antagonizing the intelligence community. “We have decided to work with” the firms, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said at a news conference, “to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have so that fixes can be developed and pushed out, so that people can be secured. ” Once the patches are sent out  —   or, as Assange put it, “once this material is effectively disarmed by us”  —   WikiLeaks will release more details publicly, he said. Assange’s remarks come two days after the radical transparency site put up a cache of files describing secret CIA hacking techniques and tools aimed at, for instance, seizing control of iPhones and Google’s Android phones, turning some Samsung television sets into bugging devices and getting data from devices not connected to the Internet. The release stopped short of releasing the code itself.  The CIA continues to have no comment on the authenticity of the documents released, which WikiLeaks said is the first tranche of more to come. Independent experts have said the files appear to describe authentic “exploits,” or tools that hackers can use to penetrate a device, but many of them are dated and appear to have already been patched by tech firms. And researchers said they have been long aware of a number of the techniques.   [WikiLeaks disclosure exposes rapid growth of CIA digital operations  —   and agency vulnerabilities]  A CIA spokesman, Jonathan Liu, suggested that WikiLeaks’ pronouncements of the scale and impact of its Tuesday “Vault 7” release are exaggerated. “As we’ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity,” Liu said. “Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, CIA continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries. ” U. S. laws and policies bar the CIA from conducting electronic surveillance targeting individuals on U. S. soil. “And CIA does not do so,” Liu said.  Within the CIA, officials were aware before the WikiLeaks release of a loss of sensitive information, according to people familiar with the matter. The CIA’s internal security personnel, who apparently had not told the FBI, were pursuing the matter, but the scope and severity of the problem was unclear until WikiLeaks posted online the roughly 9, 000 documents on Tuesday, these individuals said. An immediate challenge for FBI investigators hunting for a possible mole is to pare down a list of suspects from the pool of people who had access to the information leaked  —   a challenging task, given that hundreds and potentially thousands of people had access to the data. After Assange’s news conference Thursday, tech companies deliberated the consequences of taking data from WikiLeaks, according to a person familiar with the discussions. They considered the legal implications of using information from documents obtained illegally and the political fallout from doing so. They questioned whether Assange was attempting to further drive a wedge between the technology industry and the U. S. government.  Some national security experts wondered why WikiLeaks had not already shared the software flaws. “If WikiLeaks were really concerned about user security, they could’ve handed these vulnerabilities over to vendors immediately upon receiving this archive,” said Adam Klein, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and an expert on national security and digital surveillance. “But we know they’ve had it for some time and haven’t done so. ” And Alex Rice, chief executive of HackerOne, the   that enlists hackers to share security flaws with tech companies for a profit, said, “This is a critical step that WikiLeaks should have taken immediately upon receipt of such information. ”   [Exposure of CIA hacking tools renews debate over Americans’ cybersecurity vs. national security]  But others praised Wikileaks’s vow to share data with tech companies. “It’s in cred ibly good news” for personal cybersecurity, said Nathan White, senior legislative manager for Access Now, a digital rights group. He noted how WikiLeaks also stands to gain from the move, since it has been criticized for publishing information without vetting it for privacy and security in the past. Apple declined to comment on Assange’s statements. The company said earlier this week that “many” of the vulnerabilities identified in the WikiLeaks documents had already been patched, and encouraged customers to download the most recent security update. Roughly 80 percent of customers using Apple’s iOS software have downloaded the latest update, the company said. Google declined to comment. The CIA dismissed any suggestion that WikiLeaks’ release served the interests of privacy and security.  “The American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the intelligence community’s ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries,” Liu said. “Such disclosures not only jeopardize U. S. personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm. ” ",Q1Z2017-03-09Z1Q
Washington Post,Q1ZKim Soffen,Q1ZPeople who took a gamble on Trump’s nomination walked away rich.,"Q1Z     Last week, Donald Trump “humbly and gratefully” accepted the Republican nomination for president, putting an end to perhaps the most unpredictable primary season in recent history. And yet, this whole time, people still tried to predict it. Last summer at Trump’s announcement and through the fall and winter, journalists called his victory “an extreme long shot,” saying he was “not a real candidate” and had “no serious chance of winning”. And people outside the news media seemed to agree. Betting markets run by companies like PredictIt and Betfair allow ordinary Americans to place bets on whether a certain event will occur. The more of a   people think the outcome is, the greater the profit would be upon its occurrence. [A visual history of Donald Trump dominating the news cycle] Betting markets, then, can be used to trace the expected probability of an event over time. In the case of Donald Trump’s nomination, it started as a serious long shot, with more than 10:1 odds, which declined over the next nine months as it became increasingly clear that Trump would be the nominee. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, had the nomination on lock this whole time, in the eyes of the market. In the graphic below, you can see how the profit made off of a bet for Trump and Clinton’s nomination changed over time.    These trend lines provide a look back at the events of the primary season and a glimpse into the psyches of the American people watching the unprecedented campaign unfold. Trump’s odds of victory started out extremely volatile, falling by a third one day and doubling over the next two, as the Trump campaign’s initial provocations  —   calling Mexicans “rapists, hiring actors to attend the announcement, fighting with Univision over holding the Miss USA pageant  —   were outside the political norm. Similar volatility occurred following his first debate appearance and subsequent conflict with moderator Megyn Kelly. But over time, it seems the markets started to habituate to Trump’s unique style, showing almost no reaction after Trump proposed a ban on Muslim immigration in December. At times, the movements in the markets seemed to be logical and predictable. There was a noticeable dip as Trump’s polling surge continued through the summer, and after Jeb Bush, originally an establishment favorite, left the race. Trump said it himself when he accepted the nomination: “Who would have believed that when we started this journey” that he would receive a   number of votes. Well, someone did. And now, they’re rolling in it.",Q1Z2016-07-25Z1Q
